# NIV Advisor Implementation Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-23
**Status**: ✅ DEPLOYED AND INTEGRATED

## Overview

Successfully built and deployed **niv-advisor** - a new, clean platform-aware advisor that replaces `niv-orchestrator-robust`. This fixes critical issues with organization confusion, double responses, and adds comprehensive platform knowledge.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. Platform Knowledge Base (`platform-knowledge.ts` - 400+ lines)
Comprehensive documentation of all SignalDesk capabilities:
- **8 Module Definitions**: NIV, Intelligence, Opportunities, Campaigns, Execute, Memory Vault, Crisis, Strategic Planning
- **5 Complete Workflows**: generate-content, execute-opportunity, build-campaign, run-intelligence, crisis-response
- **5 Common Questions**: FAQs with detailed answers
- **Platform Capabilities**: What NIV can/cannot do
- **Data Schema Reference**: Database tables and key fields

**Key Functions**:
- `getModuleInfo(moduleId)` - Get module documentation
- `getWorkflowInfo(workflowId)` - Get workflow steps
- `findRelevantKnowledge(query)` - Smart search across modules/workflows/FAQs

### 2. Platform State Awareness (`platform-state.ts` - 250+ lines)
Real-time platform state queries for NIV awareness:

**PlatformState Interface**:
```typescript
{
  opportunities: {
    total, urgent, pending, executed,
    topOpportunities: [{ id, title, score, category, expiresIn }]
  },
  campaigns: {
    total, active,
    inProgress: [{ id, goal, phase, progress }]
  },
  intelligence: {
    lastScanDate, articlesAnalyzed, opportunitiesDetected, keyFindings
  },
  crisis: { activeAlerts, sentiment, threats },
  memoryVault: { totalItems, recentContent }
}
```

**Key Functions**:
- `getPlatformState(supabase, orgId)` - Query all platform data
- `formatPlatformStateSummary(state)` - Human-readable summary
- `getOpportunityDetails(supabase, oppId)` - Detailed opportunity data
- `getCampaignDetails(supabase, campaignId)` - Detailed campaign data

### 3. System Prompt Builder (`system-prompt.ts` - 150+ lines)
Defines NIV's role as platform-aware strategic advisor:

**Core Identity**:
- Works FOR the organization (client never changes)
- Lists competitors to prevent confusion
- Real-time platform state embedded in prompt

**Three Roles**:
1. **Strategic Guidance** - Expert communications and PR strategy
2. **Platform Expert** - Know SignalDesk capabilities, guide users
3. **Execution Router** - Connect to right tools/workflows

**Critical Rules**:
1. NEVER confuse organization identity
2. Platform state is real-time - reference actual numbers
3. Single, clear response - no duplicates
4. Strategic substance - real value, not generic advice
5. Guide to action - always suggest next steps

**Key Functions**:
- `buildSystemPrompt(orgName, orgContext, platformState)` - Complete system prompt
- `buildUserPrompt(message, platformKnowledge, research)` - User prompt with context

### 4. Execution Router (`execution-router.ts` - 200+ lines)
Decision logic for routing user requests:

**Route Types**:
- `generate_content` → Routes to niv-content-intelligent-v2
- `build_campaign` → Opens Campaign Builder
- `execute_opportunity` → Opens Opportunities module
- `open_module` → Opens specific module (intelligence, execute, etc.)
- `conversational` → Strategic advice or platform guidance

**Decision Tree**:
1. Opportunity keywords → execute_opportunity
2. Campaign keywords → build_campaign
3. Content keywords + standalone → generate_content
4. Content keywords + campaign → build_campaign
5. Navigation keywords → open_module
6. User confirming previous action → repeat that action
7. Default → conversational (with research if needed)

**Key Functions**:
- `determineExecutionRoute(message, history, platformState)` - Main routing logic
- `extractCampaignGoal(message)` - Parse campaign goals
- `extractContentTypes(message)` - Identify content types
- `extractModuleName(message)` - Find module references
- `determineIfResearchNeeded(message)` - Check if Fireplexity needed
- `classifyQuestion(message)` - Question type (how_to, what, where, should, why, when)

### 5. Main Orchestrator (`index.ts` - 440 lines)
Core orchestration logic with locked organization context:

**Architecture**:
```typescript
serve(async (req) => {
  // STEP 1: LOCK ORGANIZATION CONTEXT (never changes!)
  let state = conversations.get(conversationId)
  if (!state) {
    state = {
      conversationId,
      organizationContext: { name, id, industry, competitors }, // LOCKED
      messages: [],
      lastUpdate: Date.now()
    }
    conversations.set(conversationId, state)
  }

  // STEP 2: QUERY PLATFORM STATE
  const platformState = await getPlatformState(supabase, organizationId)

  // STEP 3: DETERMINE EXECUTION ROUTE
  const executionDecision = determineExecutionRoute(message, state.messages, platformState)

  // STEP 4: EXECUTE BASED ON ROUTE
  switch (executionDecision.type) {
    case 'generate_content':
      nivResponse = await handleContentGeneration(...) // Calls niv-content-intelligent-v2
      action = { type: 'content_generation', data: {...} }
      break

    case 'build_campaign':
      nivResponse = await handleCampaignBuilding(...)
      action = { type: 'open_campaign_planner', data: {...} }
      break

    case 'execute_opportunity':
      nivResponse = "Opening Opportunities module..."
      action = { type: 'open_module', data: { module: 'opportunities', context: 'execution' } }
      break

    case 'open_module':
      nivResponse = "Opening ${moduleName}..."
      action = { type: 'open_module', data: executionData }
      break

    case 'conversational':
      nivResponse = await handleConversational(...) // Platform guidance or strategic advice
      break
  }

  // Add response to conversation
  state.messages.push({ role: 'niv', content: nivResponse, timestamp: new Date(), action })

  return { response: nivResponse, action, platformState, conversationId }
})
```

**Handler Functions**:
- `handleContentGeneration()` - Routes to niv-content-intelligent-v2, returns success message
- `handleCampaignBuilding()` - Returns message about campaign capabilities
- `handleConversational()` - Routes to platform guidance or strategic response
- `generatePlatformGuidance()` - Uses platform knowledge base for platform questions
- `conductResearch()` - Calls niv-fireplexity for real-time web research
- `generateStrategicResponse()` - Calls Claude with full context (org, platform state, research)
- `callClaude()` - Claude API integration with error handling

**Conversation Management**:
- In-memory Map for conversation state
- Max 20 messages per conversation (keeps context manageable)
- Organization context locked on first message
- Messages include: role, content, timestamp, optional action

---

## Integration Changes

### 1. API Route Update (`/src/app/api/niv-orchestrator/route.ts`)
**Before**: Called `niv-orchestrator-robust`
**After**: Calls `niv-advisor`

**Changes**:
- Updated endpoint: `${SUPABASE_URL}/functions/v1/niv-advisor`
- Updated conversationId prefix: `niv-${Date.now()}`
- Added `competitors: []` to organizationContext
- Removed `framework` parameter (not needed)

**After**: Single response flow

**Changes**:
- Removed Stage 1 (acknowledgment) - no longer needed
- Single API call to `/api/niv-orchestrator`
- Updated action handling to support niv-advisor action types:
  - `content_generation` → "View in Memory Vault" button
  - `open_campaign_planner` → "Open Campaign Builder" button

## Key Features

### 🔒 Organization Context Locking
**Problem**: NIV got confused mid-conversation about who the client is (thought Anthropic was client when OpenAI was the client)

**Solution**: Organization context is locked on first message and NEVER changes:
```typescript
if (!state) {
  state = {
    organizationContext: {
      name: 'OpenAI',
      id: '123',
      industry: 'Technology',
      competitors: ['Anthropic', 'Google', 'Microsoft']
    },
    // ...locked for entire conversation
  }
}
```

System prompt explicitly states: "You work FOR ${organizationName} - they are your client. Their competitors include: ${competitors}"

### 📊 Real-Time Platform Awareness
**Problem**: NIV didn't know what was happening on the platform

**Solution**: Queries platform state before every response:
- Current opportunities (total, urgent, pending)
- Active campaigns (with progress)
- Latest intelligence scan (articles analyzed, key findings)
- Crisis alerts (if any)
- Memory Vault content

NIV can now say: "You have 12 opportunities, 3 are urgent. Want me to highlight them?"

### 📚 Comprehensive Platform Knowledge
**Problem**: NIV couldn't answer platform usage questions

**Solution**: 400+ line knowledge base with:
- All 8 modules documented (capabilities, workflows, when to use)
- 5 complete workflows with step-by-step instructions
- Common questions with detailed answers
- Platform limitations (what NIV can/cannot do)
- Database schema reference

NIV can now answer: "How do I create a blog post?", "How do opportunities work?", "What's the difference between campaigns and content?"

### 🎯 Smart Execution Routing
**Problem**: Unclear how requests should be routed

**Solution**: Intelligent router analyzes message and routes to:
- **niv-content-intelligent-v2** for standalone content generation
- **Campaign Builder** for strategic multi-phase campaigns
- **Opportunities Module** for executing AI-detected moments
- **Other Modules** for navigation/exploration
- **Conversational** for strategic advice (with optional research via Fireplexity)

### ✅ Single Response Flow
**Problem**: Double responses, duplicate answers

**Solution**: Single API call, single response:
1. Receive message
2. Determine route
3. Execute (generate, navigate, or advise)
4. Return single response with optional action

No more acknowledgment stage that caused duplicate responses.

### 🔍 Research Integration
When needed, NIV can conduct research via Fireplexity:
```typescript
if (executionData.needsResearch) {
  const research = await conductResearch(message, orgContext, supabase)
  return await generateStrategicResponse(message, orgContext, platformState, research)
}
```

Research is triggered by keywords: "what's happening", "latest", "recent", "competitor", "market", "trend", etc.
