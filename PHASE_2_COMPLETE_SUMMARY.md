# Phase 2 Complete: Strategic Planning + Execution Orchestrator

## ✅ Everything Implemented

### Phase 1 Recap (Blueprint Improvements)
- ✅ Removed redundant stakeholder mapping section
- ✅ Restructured execution requirements → execution inventory
- ✅ Organized by Priority 1-4 (stakeholder priorities)
- ✅ Changed "Begin Execution" → "View in Strategic Planning"
- ✅ Fixed influence mapper to generate all 4 levers per stakeholder

### Phase 2 Complete (Strategic Planning Module)

#### 1. Database Layer ✅
**File:** `supabase/migrations/20251020_create_campaign_execution_items.sql`

- Created `campaign_execution_items` table
- Stores individual content items with full lifecycle tracking
- RLS policies for multi-org security
- Indexes for performance
- Auto-updating timestamps

**Schema:**
```sql
- id (UUID)
- session_id (links to campaign)
- organization_id
- stakeholder_name + stakeholder_priority
- lever_name + lever_priority
- content_type (media_pitch, social_post, thought_leadership, user_action)
- topic + target + details (JSONB)
- status (pending → generating → generated → published)
- generated_content + generation_error
- generated_at + published_at
- created_at + updated_at
```

#### 2. MemoryVault Integration ✅
**File:** `src/lib/memoryVaultIntegration.ts`

Functions:
- `getOrganizationProfile(orgId)` - Org details, industry, positioning
- `getBrandGuidelines(orgId)` - Voice, tone, key messages, do-not-say
- `getCampaignContext(sessionId)` - Campaign goal, positioning, narrative
- `getPreviousContent(sessionId, type)` - Last 5 generated pieces for context
- `buildGenerationContext()` - Combines all above for complete context

#### 3. Content Viewer Modal ✅
**File:** `src/components/execution/ContentViewerModal.tsx`

Features:
- Displays generated content with full strategic context
- Edit mode with live preview
- Copy to clipboard
- Download as text file
- Mark as published
- Strategic context display (journalist, outlet, platform, etc.)
- Type-specific rendering (media pitch, social post, thought leadership)

#### 4. Main Orchestrator Component ✅
**File:** `src/components/modules/StrategicPlanningModuleV3Complete.tsx`

**Core Features:**
- Parses blueprint into flat content item array
- Loads from/saves to database automatically
- Three view modes:
  - **Priority View** (default) - Priority 1-4 with stakeholders nested
  - **Stakeholder View** - All content grouped by stakeholder
  - **Progress Dashboard** - Visual progress tracking

**Generation Workflow:**
1. User clicks "Generate" on any item
2. Fetches complete context from MemoryVault
3. Builds detailed generation request with:
   - Org profile (name, industry, positioning)
   - Brand guidelines (voice, tone, key messages)
   - Campaign context (goal, narrative)
   - Type-specific details (journalist, platform, etc.)
4. Calls `nivContentIntelligentV2` edge function
5. Saves generated content to database
6. Updates UI status in real-time
7. User can view/edit/publish

**Batch Generation:**
- "Generate All" button per stakeholder
- Generates all pending items sequentially
- Progress indication during batch

**Error Handling:**
- Failed generations show error message
- "Retry" button appears
- Errors saved to database for debugging

**Progress Tracking:**
- Real-time status updates
- Overall completion percentage
- Breakdown by priority level
- Item counts (total, generated, pending, generating)

#### 5. Blueprint Integration ✅
**File:** `src/components/campaign-builder/CampaignBuilderWizard.tsx`

Changes:
- Added `strategic_planning` to CampaignStage type
- Imported `StrategicPlanningModuleV3Complete`
- Updated `handleExecutionStart()` to transition to strategic_planning stage
- Added strategic_planning case to stage renderer
- Simplified execution flow (removed old bulk generation logic)

**New Flow:**
```
Blueprint Generated
  ↓
Click "View in Strategic Planning"
  ↓
Transitions to strategic_planning stage
  ↓
StrategicPlanningModuleV3Complete loads
  ↓
Parses blueprint → saves items to DB
  ↓
Shows priority-based execution view
  ↓
User generates content on-demand
```

---

## How to Use

### 1. Run Database Migration

```bash
cd /Users/jonathanliebowitz/Desktop/signaldesk-v3
supabase db push
```

Or manually:
```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -f supabase/migrations/20251020_create_campaign_execution_items.sql
```

### 2. Start Using

1. **Create campaign** in Campaign Builder
2. **Generate blueprint** (VECTOR_CAMPAIGN approach)
3. **Review blueprint** - now shows execution inventory organized by priority
4. **Click "View in Strategic Planning"** - transitions to new module
5. **Module loads** - parses blueprint and saves items to database
6. **Generate content:**
   - Individual: Click "Generate" on any item
   - Batch: Click "Generate All (X)" per stakeholder
7. **View generated content** - click "View" button
8. **Edit/Copy/Download** - full content management
9. **Mark as Published** - track what's been shared
10. **Track progress** - switch to Progress view

   ├─ Brand guidelines
   ├─ Campaign context
   └─ Previous content
3. Build generation request
4. Call nivContentIntelligentV2
5. Receive generated content

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Priorities = Phases
- Old model: Awareness → Consideration → Conversion → Advocacy
- New model: Priority 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 (matches stakeholder priorities)
- Aligns execution with strategic importance

### 2. On-Demand Generation
- Don't generate all 80+ items at once
- User controls what gets generated and when
- Reduces wasted API calls
- Faster time-to-value

### 3. Flat Content Array
- Blueprint has nested structure (stakeholder → lever → campaign → items)
- Flatten to single array for easier filtering/searching
- Group dynamically in UI by priority or stakeholder

### 4. Database-First
- Save items to database immediately after parsing blueprint
- All state changes persisted
- Survives page reloads
- Multi-session support

### 5. Complete Context
- Every generation gets full MemoryVault context
- Org profile, brand guidelines, campaign goal
- Previous generated content for consistency
- Type-specific details from blueprint

## What's NOT Included

These can be added later if needed:

❌ Timeline/Gantt chart view (have Priority view instead)
❌ Task dependencies (not needed for content generation)
❌ Team assignment (future feature)
❌ Notifications/alerts (future feature)
❌ Direct publishing to social platforms (future feature)
❌ Content calendar integration (future feature)
❌ A/B testing variants (future feature)

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. **Test the complete flow** - create campaign, generate blueprint, use strategic planning
2. **Verify database migration** worked correctly
3. **Test content generation** with real org context
4. **Test batch generation** for stakeholders

### Short-term
1. Add Stakeholder View implementation (currently shows placeholder)
2. Add content filtering/search
3. Add export functionality (CSV/PDF of all generated content)
4. Add content templates/examples

### Medium-term
1. Content performance tracking (if published to platforms)
2. AI feedback on generated content quality
3. Suggested improvements based on brand guidelines
4. Content calendar integration

## Success Metrics

Track these to measure effectiveness:

1. **Adoption Rate**
   - % of blueprints that transition to strategic planning
   - Target: 80%+

2. **Generation Rate**
   - % of execution items that get generated
   - Target: 60%+ (not all items will be needed)

3. **Time to First Content**
   - Time from blueprint → first generated piece
   - Target: < 2 minutes

4. **Content Quality**
   - User edits needed per generated piece
   - Target: < 20% significant edits

5. **Completion Rate**
   - % of Priority 1 items generated
   - Target: 90%+

---

## Technical Debt / Future Improvements

1. **Optimize MemoryVault queries** - currently makes 4 separate queries, could batch
2. **Add caching** - cache org profile/brand guidelines for session
3. **Streaming generation** - show content as it's generated (not all at once)
4. **Better error recovery** - automatic retry with exponential backoff
5. **Content versioning** - track edits and revisions
6. **Collaborative editing** - multiple users editing same content
