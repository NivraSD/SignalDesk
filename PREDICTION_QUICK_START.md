# Prediction System Quick Start

## 🎯 Two Core Capabilities

### 1. Single Event Detection

**What it does:** Instantly generates predictions when intelligence arrives

**Example:**
```
Event arrives:
"Microsoft announces 10,000 layoffs"

→ System matches to "Microsoft" target
→ Finds pattern: "Layoffs → Restructuring"
→ Generates prediction:

🔮 "Microsoft likely to restructure cloud division within 3 months"
   Confidence: 75% (pattern has 75% historical accuracy)
   Trigger: Microsoft layoff announcement
```

**Flow:**
```
Intelligence → Target Match → Pattern Match → Prediction → Alert
```

### 2. Time-Based Tracking

**What it does:** Monitors predictions, validates outcomes, learns from results

**Example:**
```
T+0 days:  Prediction created "AWS will launch new AI service in 3 months"
T+30 days: Monitoring detects 2 supporting signals → confidence ↑ to 82%
T+75 days: Outcome detected! "AWS announces SageMaker Pro"
           ✅ Validated | 88% accurate | AWS accuracy now 83% (5/6)
```

**Flow:**
```
Create → Monitor → Detect Outcome → Validate → Learn → Improve
```

## 🚀 How To Use It

### Step 1: Set Up Targets
```typescript
// Add your competitors
const targets = [
  { name: 'Microsoft', type: 'competitor', priority: 'high' },
  { name: 'Google', type: 'competitor', priority: 'high' },
  { name: 'AI Regulation', type: 'topic', priority: 'medium' }
]
```

### Step 2: Define Patterns
```typescript
// Create predictive patterns
const pattern = {
  name: "Price Cut → Market Share Push",
  trigger_signals: ["price reduction", "discount", "promotion"],
  typical_outcome: "increase marketing spend significantly",
  typical_timeframe: "1-month",
  confidence_threshold: 60, // Generate prediction if ≥60% match
  historical_accuracy: 85 // 85% of past predictions came true
}
```

### Step 3: Process Events
```typescript
// When intelligence arrives
const event = {
  title: "Microsoft cuts Azure prices by 20%",
  content: "...",
  source: "TechCrunch"
}

// System automatically:
const predictions = await EventPredictionService.processEvent(event, orgId)
// → Generates: "Microsoft likely to increase Azure marketing 200% in 1 month"
```

### Step 4: Monitor & Validate
```typescript
// Daily monitoring (automated)
await PredictionMonitoringService.monitorActivePredictions(orgId)

// System checks:
// - Has deadline passed?
// - Any evidence of outcome?
// - Update status: active → validated/expired
```

### Step 5: View Results
```typescript
// Dashboard shows:
"Microsoft (Competitor)
 📊 Accuracy: 83% (10/12 predictions)
 🔮 Active: 3 predictions
 ✅ Validated: 10 predictions
 ⏰ Monitoring: 2 imminent"
```

## 📊 Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Competitive Intelligence

**Setup:**
- Target: "Google" (competitor)
- Pattern: "Product Shutdown → Pivot to Enterprise"
- Historical accuracy: 75% (6/8 times Google pivoted instead of shutting down)

**Event arrives:**
"Google Stadia user base drops 60%"

**Prediction generated:**
"Google likely to pivot Stadia to B2B offering within 6 months" (75% confidence)

**Monitoring:**
- Day 30: Supporting signal detected → "Google hiring enterprise sales for Stadia"
- Day 90: Supporting signal → "Google presents Stadia at enterprise gaming conference"
- Confidence increases to 85%

**Outcome (Day 120):**
"Google announces Stadia for Enterprise"
✅ Prediction validated | 90% accurate | Pattern strengthened to 78% (7/9)

---

### Scenario 2: Regulatory Tracking

**Setup:**
- Target: "AI Regulation" (topic)
- Pattern: "Hearing → Legislation Draft"
- Historical accuracy: 60% (3/5 hearings led to draft bills)

**Event:**
"Senate holds AI safety hearing with tech CEOs"

**Prediction:**
"Congress likely to draft AI safety legislation within 3 months" (60% confidence)

**Monitoring:**
- Day 45: No signals detected
- Day 90: Deadline passes, no legislation drafted
- Status: Expired ❌

**Learning:**
- Pattern accuracy drops to 50% (3/6)
- Note added: "Hearings alone insufficient signal - look for bipartisan support"
- Pattern updated: Now requires 2+ signals (hearing + bipartisan statement)

---

### Scenario 3: Market Opportunity

**Setup:**
- Target: "Microsoft" (competitor)
- Pattern: "Acquisition → Product Integration"
- Historical accuracy: 90% (9/10 acquisitions integrated within 12 months)

"Microsoft acquires AI startup Inflection for $650M"

**Prediction:**
"Microsoft will integrate Inflection AI into Bing within 12 months" (90% confidence)

**Your Action:**
- Alert: High-confidence prediction about Microsoft
- Recommended actions:
  1. Monitor Bing product updates
  2. Prepare competitive response
  3. Brief leadership on potential Microsoft AI advantage

**Outcome (9 months later):**

## 🎓 Learning Loop

```
Create Pattern → Generate Predictions → Monitor → Validate → Refine Pattern
        ↑                                                          ↓
        └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

Example Learning Cycle:

Iteration 1: "Layoffs → Restructuring" (70% confidence)
- 10 predictions made
- 7 came true (70% accurate) ✅
- Keep pattern, no changes

Iteration 2: Pattern used 10 more times
- 9 came true (90% accurate!) 🎯
- Pattern confidence boosted to 80%
- Pattern now generates higher-confidence predictions

Iteration 3: 5 predictions failed
- Analysis: All failures were in retail industry
- Refinement: Split pattern by industry
  - Tech: "Layoffs → Restructuring" (95% accurate)
  - Retail: "Layoffs → Store Closures" (85% accurate)
```

## 🔥 Quick Wins

### Win 1: Start Simple
Just track 1-2 high-priority competitors with basic patterns:
```
Target: Your #1 competitor
Patterns:
- "Funding Round → Hiring Surge"
- "Product Launch → Marketing Blitz"
```

### Win 2: Validate Manually First
Before automation, manually validate a few predictions to build pattern library:
```
Week 1-2: Create 5 predictions manually
Week 3-4: Check if they came true
Week 5: Use validated patterns to auto-generate future predictions
```

### Win 3: Focus on High-Confidence
Only act on predictions ≥ 80% confidence until patterns are proven:
```
≥ 90%: Take action immediately
80-89%: Monitor closely, prepare response
70-79%: Watch only
< 70%: Ignore or track for learning
```
