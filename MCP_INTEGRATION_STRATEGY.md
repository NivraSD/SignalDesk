# SignalDesk MCP Integration Strategy

## 🎯 Development & Integration Workflow

### Phase 1: Claude Desktop Development (Current)
Use Claude Desktop to rapidly prototype and populate MCPs with data.

```
Claude Desktop → Test & Populate → Production Supabase
```

### Phase 2: Production Integration
Once stable, integrate MCPs with Supabase Edge Functions for web platform access.

## 🧠 MemoryVault's Role

**Purpose**: Persistent context layer for all PR activities

### Key Functions:
1. **Store** - Every interaction, decision, and outcome
2. **Learn** - Pattern recognition across campaigns
3. **Provide** - Historical context to all MCPs
4. **Enable** - Contextual responses ("Last time with TechCrunch...")

### Integration Points:
- Feeds historical data to Opportunity Engine
- Stores successful campaign patterns
- Maintains journalist preferences
- Tracks message effectiveness

---

## 🚀 Campaign Orchestrator's Role

**Purpose**: Execution engine for multi-step PR campaigns

### Key Functions:
1. **Receive** - Opportunities from Opportunity Engine
2. **Plan** - Multi-step campaign workflows
3. **Coordinate** - Content, distribution, follow-ups
4. **Track** - Progress and adjust strategy

### Integration with MCPs:
```javascript
Campaign Flow:
1. Intelligence MCP → Identifies opportunity
2. Analytics MCP → Scores opportunity value
3. Campaign Orchestrator → Creates execution plan
4. Content MCP → Generates materials
5. Relationships MCP → Identifies best journalists
6. Workflow MCP → Manages approvals
7. Distribution MCP → Sends content
8. Analytics MCP → Measures results
9. MemoryVault → Stores learnings
```

---

## 🔧 Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Build & Test MCPs Locally
```bash
# For each new MCP
cd mcp-servers/signaldesk-intelligence
npm install
npm run build

# Test with Claude Desktop
# Copy claude-desktop-config-complete.json to Claude config location
```

### Step 2: Populate with Initial Data
Use Claude Desktop to:
1. Create initial journalist database
2. Set up competitor tracking
3. Configure analytics dashboards
4. Generate content templates

### Step 3: Create Supabase Edge Functions
```javascript
// supabase/functions/mcp-bridge/index.ts
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@0.168.0/http/server.ts"

serve(async (req) => {
  const { mcp, tool, params } = await req.json()
  
  // Route to appropriate MCP
  switch(mcp) {
    case 'intelligence':
      return handleIntelligenceMCP(tool, params)
    case 'relationships':
      return handleRelationshipsMCP(tool, params)
    // ... other MCPs
  }
})
```

### Step 4: Connect Niv to MCPs
```javascript
// In AdaptiveNivAssistant.js
const enrichOpportunityWithMCPs = async (opportunity) => {
  // Get intelligence context
  const intelligence = await supabaseApiService.callEdgeFunction('mcp-bridge', {
    mcp: 'intelligence',
    tool: 'market_narrative_tracking',
    params: { keywords: opportunity.keywords }
  })
  
  // Get relationship data
  const relationships = await supabaseApiService.callEdgeFunction('mcp-bridge', {
    mcp: 'relationships',
    tool: 'find_best_journalists',
    params: { beat: opportunity.type }
  })
  
  // Generate content
  const content = await supabaseApiService.callEdgeFunction('mcp-bridge', {
    mcp: 'content',
    tool: 'generate_pitch',
    params: { opportunity, journalists: relationships }
  })
  
  return { opportunity, intelligence, relationships, content }
}
```

## 📈 Data Flow Example

### User Query: "I need to announce our Series B funding"

1. **Niv** receives query
2. **Intelligence MCP** checks competitor funding announcements
3. **Analytics MCP** identifies best timing and approach
4. **MemoryVault** recalls previous funding announcement success
5. **Campaign Orchestrator** creates multi-phase plan:
   - Phase 1: Exclusive to tier-1 outlet
   - Phase 2: Broad announcement
   - Phase 3: Executive interviews
6. **Content MCP** generates:
   - Press release
   - Pitch variants
   - Executive talking points
7. **Relationships MCP** identifies:
   - Best journalists for exclusive
   - Secondary tier targets
   - Optimal send times
8. **Workflow MCP** manages approvals
9. **Distribution MCP** executes sends
10. **Analytics MCP** tracks results
11. **MemoryVault** stores learnings

## 🎮 Quick Start Commands

### 1. Build All MCPs
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for mcp in intelligence relationships analytics content; do
  echo "Building signaldesk-$mcp..."
  cd mcp-servers/signaldesk-$mcp
  npm install
  npm run build
  cd ../..
done
```

### 2. Test with Claude Desktop
1. Copy `claude-desktop-config-complete.json` to Claude config
2. Restart Claude Desktop
3. Test: "Show me competitor moves in the last week"

### 3. Deploy to Supabase
```bash
# Deploy MCP bridge function
supabase functions deploy mcp-bridge
```
