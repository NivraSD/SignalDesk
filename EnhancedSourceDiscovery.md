## Intelligent Source Discovery Process

```javascript
const EnhancedSourceDiscovery = {
  // Step 1: AI-Powered Source Identification
  async discoverSources(stakeholder, organizationContext) {
    const sourceQuery = `
      Find ALL available information sources for ${stakeholder.name}:
      
      1. Official channels and communications
      2. Regulatory filings and disclosures
      3. Media coverage and interviews
      4. Social media presence
      5. Industry databases and platforms
      6. Events and conferences
      7. Alternative data sources
      8. Academic and research coverage
      9. Third-party analysis and reports
      10. Historical archives and records
      
      Context: Monitoring for ${organizationContext.name} in ${organizationContext.industry}
      Priority: ${stakeholder.selectedTopics.join(', ')}
    `;

    const discoveredSources = await researchOrchestrator.execute({
      query: sourceQuery,
      agents: ['web-researcher', 'data-analyst'],
      depth: 'exhaustive'
    });

    return processAndValidateSources(discoveredSources);
  },

  // Step 2: Source Validation & Ranking
  async validateSources(sources, stakeholder) {
    return sources.map(source => ({
      ...source,
      reliability: assessSourceReliability(source),
      relevance: calculateRelevance(source, stakeholder),
      updateFrequency: detectUpdatePatterns(source),
      accessMethod: determineOptimalAccess(source),
      cost: estimateAccessCost(source),
      automationPotential: assessAutomation(source)
    }));
  },

  // Step 3: Optimal Configuration
  generateOptimalConfiguration(validatedSources, budget, priorities) {
    // AI selects best combination of sources
    return {
      tier1: validatedSources.filter(s => s.relevance > 0.8 && s.reliability > 0.9),
      tier2: validatedSources.filter(s => s.relevance > 0.6 && s.reliability > 0.7),
      tier3: validatedSources.filter(s => s.relevance > 0.4),
      automated: validatedSources.filter(s => s.automationPotential > 0.8),
      manual: validatedSources.filter(s => s.automationPotential < 0.3),
      totalCoverage: calculateCoverageScore(validatedSources, priorities)
    };
  }
};
```

## Implementation Benefits

1. **10-50x More Sources**: Each stakeholder monitored through dozens of sources instead of 3-4
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: No blind spots - official, unofficial, and alternative sources
3. **Intelligent Prioritization**: AI ranks sources by reliability and relevance
4. **Cost Optimization**: Mix of free and premium sources based on value
5. **Automation First**: Prioritizes sources that can be automated
6. **Continuous Discovery**: System keeps finding new sources as they emerge

This enhanced source discovery ensures you're capturing every signal about stakeholder sentiment, intentions, and actions - not just the obvious ones.
