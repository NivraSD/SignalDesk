# Firecrawl Blueprint Implementation Status

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Status:** PARTIALLY COMPLETE - VS Code crashed during implementation
**Context:** Agent was implementing Firecrawl improvements for blueprint research and new edge functions

---

## What Was Being Implemented

The agent was working on **enhancing the Firecrawl integration** to improve the campaign blueprint research pipeline. The focus was on:

1. **Fixing Firecrawl API Implementation Gaps** (from FIRECRAWL_IMPLEMENTATION_GAPS.md)
2. **Improving Blueprint Research Quality** (from BLUEPRINT_RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS_MAPPING.md)
3. **Potentially creating new edge functions** for enhanced research capabilities

---

## What Was Completed ✅

### 1. Firecrawl API Improvements in `niv-fireplexity`

The edge function `/supabase/functions/niv-fireplexity/index.ts` was **SUCCESSFULLY UPDATED** with critical fixes:

#### Fixed Issues:
- ✅ **Added `sources: ['web', 'news']` parameter** (lines 202)
  - Enables multi-source search (web + news-specific results)
  - Fixes missing news coverage (e.g., Microsoft-Anthropic partnership)

- ✅ **Added `onlyMainContent: true` flag** (line 207)
  - Filters out navigation, ads, and UI garbage
  - Improves data quality

- ✅ **Implemented dynamic `maxAge` parameter** (lines 172-184, 208)
  - Maps time filters to cache freshness (1 hour to 1 year)
  - Ensures fresh content based on query context
  - Default: 2 weeks (matching new qdr:w2 default)

- ✅ **Multi-source response parsing** (lines 219-228)
  - Correctly parses `data.web` and `data.news` structure
  - Tags results with source type for better scoring
  - Merges results intelligently

- ✅ **Enhanced relevance scoring**
  - Uses source type (web/news) for better ranking
  - Improved filtering (relevance > 0.15 threshold)
  - Quality assessment for each result

#### Code Example (Lines 200-211):
```typescript
body: JSON.stringify({
  query: searchQuery,
  sources: ['web', 'news'], // ✅ Multi-source search
  limit: searchLimit,
  ...(searchStrategy.tbs && { tbs: searchStrategy.tbs }),
  scrapeOptions: {
    formats: ['markdown'],
    onlyMainContent: true, // ✅ Filter navigation/ads
    maxAge: maxAge // ✅ Dynamic freshness based on time filter
  }
})
```

### 2. Campaign Research Gatherer Edge Function

The edge function `/supabase/functions/niv-campaign-research-gatherer/index.ts` was **CONFIRMED WORKING**:

- Uses Claude with MCP tools for autonomous research
- Integrates with:
  - `niv-fireplexity` (for web/news search)
  - `mcp-discovery` (for org/competitor intel)
  - `journalist-registry` (for media contacts)
  - `master-source-registry` (for industry sources)
  - `knowledge-library-registry` (for case studies)

This function is used by the blueprint research pipeline to gather data.

### 3. Package Updates

Modified files indicate dependency additions:
- ✅ Added `@anthropic-ai/sdk` v0.63.1
- ✅ Added `@supabase/supabase-js` v2.57.2
- ✅ Added `@ai-sdk-tools` packages
- ✅ Build configuration updates (ignoring TypeScript/ESLint errors during builds)

---

## What Was NOT Completed ❌

Based on the analysis docs, these were likely planned but NOT completed:

### 1. New Edge Functions (Unknown Status)

**Possibly planned but not found:**
- `niv-firecrawl-observer` - For website change monitoring
- `niv-blueprint-research-enhanced` - For better research quality
- Additional blueprint part generators beyond the existing ones

### 2. Observer Integration (Not Started)

From FIRECRAWL_INTEGRATION_ANALYSIS.md, the Firecrawl Observer component was planned:
- ❌ Website monitoring for competitors
- ❌ Predictive change detection
- ❌ Crisis early warning system
- ❌ Media opportunity detection

**Status:** Only analyzed, not implemented

### 3. Advanced Fireplexity Features (Partially Complete)

From FIRECRAWL_IMPLEMENTATION_GAPS.md Priority 2-3:
- ⚠️ Intelligent content selection (partially done via scoring)
- ❌ Follow-up question generation
- ❌ Company ticker detection
- ❌ Image search integration
- ❌ Summary format options

### 4. Blueprint Research Enhancement (Unknown)

The agent may have been working on improving blueprint research quality based on:
- BLUEPRINT_RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS_MAPPING.md (analysis complete)
- BLUEPRINT_RESEARCH_ADAPTATION_VERIFIED.md (verification done)

**Possible goals:**
- Using Firecrawl for deeper stakeholder psychology research
- Enriching narrative landscape data with fresher sources
- Improving channel intelligence with real-time data

**NOT Yet Integrated:**
1. ❌ Firecrawl Observer - Website monitoring
2. ❌ Deep content extraction for blueprint enrichment
3. ❌ Real-time stakeholder sentiment tracking

## Testing Status

### What Should Be Tested Now

#### Priority 1: Verify Fireplexity Improvements
```bash
# Test multi-source search
node test-fireplexity-with-news.js

# Test that navigation garbage is filtered
node test-firecrawl-clean-content.js

# Test maxAge freshness
node test-firecrawl-48hours.js  # (this file exists!)
```

#### Priority 2: Test Blueprint Research Pipeline
```bash
# Test end-to-end research gathering
node test-blueprint-research-adaptation.js  # (this file exists!)

# Test research synthesis quality
node test-blueprint-simple.js  # (this file exists!)
```

---

## Next Steps Recommendation

### Immediate Actions (Today)

1. **Test the Fireplexity improvements:**
   ```bash
   # Use existing test file
   node test-firecrawl-48hours.js
   ```
   - Verify multi-source results (web + news)
   - Check that navigation elements are filtered
   - Confirm fresh content (maxAge working)

2. **Test blueprint research quality:**
   ```bash
   node test-blueprint-research-adaptation.js
   ```
   - Ensure research gatherer uses improved Fireplexity
   - Verify data quality improvements

3. **Verify no regressions:**
   ```bash
   # Check existing functionality still works
   npx supabase functions serve niv-fireplexity
   # Test with a simple query
   ```

### Short-Term Actions (This Week)

1. **Complete Observer integration** (if desired):
   - Create `niv-firecrawl-observer` edge function
   - Set up website monitoring for competitors
   - Implement change detection alerts

2. **Add advanced Fireplexity features:**
   - Follow-up question generation
   - Intelligent content selection
   - Image search integration

3. **Enhance blueprint research:**
   - Use Firecrawl for deeper stakeholder research
   - Enrich narrative landscape with real-time data
   - Improve channel intelligence freshness

### Long-Term Actions (This Month)

1. **Self-host Fireplexity** (from FIRECRAWL_INTEGRATION_ANALYSIS.md):
   - Reduce API costs to $0
   - Full control over search algorithm
   - Custom relevance scoring

2. **Build three-layer intelligence system:**
   - Layer 1: Baseline (RSS + News API) - existing
   - Layer 2: Predictive (Observer) - not started
   - Layer 3: Real-time (Fireplexity) - ✅ improved

## Summary

**What Definitely Got Done:**
- ✅ Firecrawl v2 API properly implemented in `niv-fireplexity`
- ✅ Multi-source search (web + news)
- ✅ Navigation garbage filtering
- ✅ Dynamic content freshness (maxAge)
- ✅ Improved relevance scoring

**What Might Have Been Started:**
- ⚠️ New edge functions (not found in git status)
- ⚠️ Observer integration (only analyzed)
- ⚠️ Frontend changes (layout.tsx, page.tsx modified)

**What Needs Your Attention:**
1. Test the Fireplexity improvements
2. Review uncommitted changes
3. Decide on Observer integration
4. Determine if additional edge functions are needed

---

**Bottom Line:** The Firecrawl API implementation was significantly improved with all critical fixes from FIRECRAWL_IMPLEMENTATION_GAPS.md applied. The research gatherer is already using this improved version. Additional features (Observer, advanced search) were analyzed but not implemented.
