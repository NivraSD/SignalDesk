# Presentation Workflow - Research Integration Complete ‚úÖ

## Overview
Presentations now follow the same intelligent workflow pattern as media plans: outline ‚Üí research ‚Üí approve ‚Üí generate.

## Workflow Steps

### 1. User Requests Presentation
```
User: "Create a presentation about public response to Codex"
```

### 2. NIV Gathers Requirements
NIV asks clarifying questions:
- Audience (executives, technical team, investors, etc.)
- Purpose (board update, public presentation, etc.)
- Focus areas (adoption, sentiment, competitive, etc.)
- Length (5 slides, 12 slides, etc.)

### 3. NIV Creates Outline (Triggers Research)
When NIV calls `create_presentation_outline`, backend:

**a) Creates structured outline** with:
- Topic and audience
- Key messages (3-5 points)
- Section-by-section breakdown
- Talking points for each slide
- Visual suggestions

**b) Automatically extracts research topics** by:
- Adding main topic
- Parsing section titles for keywords: "response", "reception", "market", "competitive", "analysis", "sentiment", "feedback", "adoption", "trends"
- Extracting talking points as research queries

**c) Conducts research** using Fireplexity:
- Searches for main topic + key sections
- Finds relevant articles with real data
- Generates synthesis of findings

### 4. NIV Presents Outline + Research Together
Response includes:
```json
{
  "mode": "presentation_outline",
  "presentationOutline": {
    "topic": "...",
    "audience": "...",
    "sections": [...]
  },
  "researchData": {
    "articles": [...],
    "synthesis": "..."
  }
}
```

User sees:
- Complete presentation structure
- Research findings that will populate it
- Key insights from real data sources

### 5. User Approves
User says: "looks good", "approved", "generate it", "send to Gamma"

### 6. Generate in Gamma
NIV calls `generate_presentation` with:
- Approved outline
- Research data for factual content
- Gamma creates visual presentation

## Code Implementation

### Backend: niv-content-intelligent-v2/index.ts

**Research Topic Extraction (lines 2100-2127):**
```typescript
// Extract research topics from the outline
const researchTopics: string[] = []

// Add main topic
researchTopics.push(toolUse.input.topic)

// Extract topics from sections that need factual data
toolUse.input.sections.forEach((section: any) => {
  const sectionTitle = section.title.toLowerCase()

  // Look for sections that need market/response/competitive data
  if (sectionTitle.includes('response') ||
      sectionTitle.includes('reception') ||
      sectionTitle.includes('market') ||
      sectionTitle.includes('competitive') ||
      sectionTitle.includes('analysis') ||
      sectionTitle.includes('sentiment') ||
      sectionTitle.includes('feedback') ||
      sectionTitle.includes('adoption') ||
      sectionTitle.includes('trends')) {
    // Extract talking points as research queries
    section.talking_points.forEach((point: string) => {
      if (point.length < 100) {
        researchTopics.push(point)
      }
    })
  }
})
```

**Research Execution (lines 2137-2138):**
```typescript
const researchQuery = `${toolUse.input.topic} ${researchTopics.slice(1, 4).join(' ')}`
researchData = await executeResearch(researchQuery, organizationId)
```

**Response with Research (lines 2162-2173):**
```typescript
if (researchData?.articles?.length > 0) {
  outline += `\n## Research Findings

I found ${researchData.articles.length} relevant articles to support this presentation:

${researchData.articles.slice(0, 5).map((article: any, i: number) =>
  `${i + 1}. **${article.title}**\n   ${article.summary || article.description || ''}\n   Source: ${article.source || article.url || 'Web'}`
).join('\n\n')}

${researchData.synthesis ? `\n**Key Insights:** ${researchData.synthesis}\n` : ''}
`
}
```

### System Prompt: system-prompt.ts

**Workflow Documentation (lines 88-130):**
```typescript
**PRESENTATION WORKFLOW (NEW - Important!):**

When a user asks for a presentation/deck:

**This workflow is SIMILAR TO MEDIA PLANS:**
1. Gather key information
2. Create outline (like strategy document)
3. **Backend automatically researches based on outline topics**
4. Present outline + research findings
5. User approves
6. Generate in Gamma
```

### Frontend: NIVContentOrchestratorProduction.tsx

**Auto-Execute UI (lines 2173-2212):**
After presentation completes, shows action buttons:
- Executive Summary (1-pager)
- Speaker Notes
- Detailed Report

Each button auto-fills input with context and triggers generation.

## Test Results

Verified with `test-presentation-complete-flow.js`:

```
‚úÖ OUTLINE MODE ACTIVATED!
‚úÖ RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED!
üìö Found 43 articles

üìù PRESENTATION OUTLINE:
Topic: Product Reception Board Update
Audience: Technical executives
Slides: 12

üéØ Key Messages:
1. Developer adoption metrics show strong early traction
2. Community sentiment analysis reveals positive reception
3. Competitive positioning demonstrates clear differentiation

üìë Sections: 12
1. Executive Summary
2. Developer Adoption Overview
3. Integration Patterns & Use Cases
4. Developer Segment Analysis
5. Community Sentiment Metrics
```

## Benefits

### Before
- NIV guessed if research was needed from initial message
- Created outlines from training data (hallucinations)
- User couldn't see what data would be included
- Presentations lacked factual grounding

### After
- NIV creates outline identifying what data is needed
- Backend automatically researches those topics
- User sees structure + research findings together
- User approves with full visibility
- Gamma generates with real, factual content

## Architecture Pattern

This matches the proven **Media Plan Workflow**:

| Step | Media Plans | Presentations |
|------|-------------|---------------|
| 1. Identify needs | Create strategy document | Create outline |
| 2. Research | Research based on strategy | Research based on outline |
| 3. Review | Present strategy + research | Present outline + research |
| 4. Approve | User approves strategy | User approves outline |
| 5. Generate | Generate 7 tactical pieces | Generate in Gamma |

Both workflows ensure **user visibility and control** over what data informs the final output.

## Deployment Status

‚úÖ Deployed to production:
```bash
npx supabase functions deploy niv-content-intelligent-v2
```

Script size: 127.1kB
Status: Successfully deployed

## Next Steps

No pending work - implementation complete and tested.

User can now request presentations and see what research will populate them before approving generation.
