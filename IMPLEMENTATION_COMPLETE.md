# Framework â†’ Content Auto-Execute Implementation COMPLETE

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Framework Generator Updates (`niv-orchestrator-robust`)

**Added Two New Fields to Every Framework:**

#### A) `contentStrategy` - Content-Ready Format
Flat structure that matches what `niv-content-intelligent-v2` expects (same as media plans):

```typescript
contentStrategy: {
  subject: "AI Leadership Strategy",
  narrative: "Position as AI safety leader...",
  target_audiences: ["Investors", "Industry Executives", "Media & Analysts"],
  key_messages: ["Key message 1", "Key message 2", ...],
  media_targets: ["TechCrunch", "WSJ", "Bloomberg", ...],
  timeline: "1 week for preparation, 2-3 weeks for execution",
  chosen_approach: "Strategic positioning based on competitive analysis",
  tactical_recommendations: ["Establish thought leadership", ...]
}
```

**Helper Functions Built:**
- `buildContentStrategy()` - Main orchestrator
- `buildContentNarrative()` - Enriches narrative with intelligence context
- `buildTargetAudiences()` - Extracts audiences from stakeholders
- `buildKeyMessages()` - Combines objective + findings + plays
- `buildMediaTargets()` - Intelligent media outlet suggestions
- `buildContentTimeline()` - Maps urgency to execution timeline

#### B) `executionPlan` - Auto vs Manual Separation
Separates what platform can auto-execute from what needs manual execution:

```typescript
executionPlan: {
  autoExecutableContent: {
    contentTypes: ['press-release', 'media-pitch', 'qa-document', ...],
    description: "Content that will be automatically generated",
    estimatedPieces: 7
  },
  strategicRecommendations: {
    campaigns: [
      {
        title: "Product Launch Event Series",
        type: "event",
        description: "Host exclusive product demos...",
        rationale: "Hands-on demos create earned media...",
        executionSteps: ["1. Secure venues...", "2. Invite journalists..."],
        resources_needed: ["Event venues ($5k-10k)", ...],
        timeline: "3-4 weeks for full series",
        success_metrics: ["Media coverage from 50%+ of attendees", ...],
        platform_support: {
          generatable_assets: ['event-invitation-email', ...],
          templates_provided: ['demo-script', 'talking-points'],
          research_provided: true
        }
      },
      // ... more campaigns based on workflow type
    ]
  }
}
```

**Strategic Campaigns Generated by Workflow Type:**
- **Launch**: Product Launch Events + Influencer Unboxing Campaign
- **Crisis**: Crisis Monitoring & Response Center
- **Thought Leadership**: Executive Speaking Tour + Content Series
- **Competitive**: Analyst Relations Program

### 2. Framework Auto-Execute Edge Function

**New Function**: `framework-auto-execute`

**What It Does:**
1. Receives framework from NIV Canvas "Execute" button
2. Saves framework to folder: `strategic-frameworks/{framework-name}/`
3. Loops through all `autoExecutableContent` types
4. Calls `niv-content-intelligent-v2` for each type in auto-execute mode
5. Saves all generated content to same folder
6. Generates markdown playbooks for strategic campaigns
7. Saves playbooks to `strategic-frameworks/{framework-name}/playbooks/`
8. Returns summary of what was generated

**Playbook Markdown Format:**
- Campaign title & description
- Why it works (rationale)
- Step-by-step execution guide
- Resources needed with budgets
- Success metrics
- Platform support (what SignalDesk generates vs what user does)

### 3. Content Generator Updates (`niv-content-intelligent-v2`)

**New Auto-Execute Mode:**

```typescript
if (autoExecute && preloadedStrategy && requestedContentType) {
  // Skip conversation - generate immediately
  // Use preloaded strategy from framework
  // Save to specified folder
  // Return content
}
```

**Parameters:**
- `preloadedStrategy` - The `contentStrategy` from framework
- `requestedContentType` - Which content type to generate
- `autoExecute` - Flag to enter this mode
- `saveFolder` - Where to save (framework folder)

**Flow:**
1. Set up conversation state with preloaded strategy
2. Call MCP service directly (no conversation)
3. Save generated content to folder
4. Return success

### 4. NIV Canvas Execute Button

**Updated Button Logic:**
```typescript
onClick={async () => {
  // 1. Call /api/supabase/functions/framework-auto-execute
  // 2. Pass framework + organizationId
  // 3. Show loading state
  // 4. Display success message with count of generated content
  // 5. Also send framework to Strategic Planning component
}}
```

**User Experience:**
- Button shows "Executing..." while running
- Disabled during execution
- Success message shows:
  - How many pieces auto-generated
  - How many playbooks created
  - Where everything is saved
  - Next steps

### 5. API Route

**New Route**: `/api/supabase/functions/framework-auto-execute/route.ts`

Simple proxy to edge function with proper error handling.

## File Structure After Execution

```
Memory Vault/
â””â”€â”€ strategic-frameworks/
    â””â”€â”€ ai-leadership-strategy/
        â”œâ”€â”€ framework.json                    # Full framework
        â”œâ”€â”€ ai-leadership-strategy-press-release.md
        â”œâ”€â”€ ai-leadership-strategy-media-pitch.md
        â”œâ”€â”€ ai-leadership-strategy-qa-document.md
        â”œâ”€â”€ ai-leadership-strategy-talking-points.md
        â”œâ”€â”€ ai-leadership-strategy-social-post.md
        â”œâ”€â”€ ai-leadership-strategy-email.md
        â”œâ”€â”€ ai-leadership-strategy-media-pitch.md
        â””â”€â”€ playbooks/
            â”œâ”€â”€ product-launch-event-series.md
            â””â”€â”€ influencer-unboxing-campaign.md
```

## User Flow (End-to-End)

### Before (Broken):
```
1. User generates framework in NIV
2. Framework shows generic content suggestions
3. User clicks "Execute" â†’ nothing happens
4. User has to manually go to Execute tab
5. User re-explains entire strategy
6. Content generated with no link to framework
```

### After (Working):
```
1. User generates framework in NIV
2. Framework includes:
   âœ… Content-ready strategy format
   âœ… List of auto-executable content types
   âœ… Strategic campaign playbooks
3. User clicks "Execute Campaign"
4. System automatically:
   âœ… Creates folder in Memory Vault
   âœ… Saves framework
   âœ… Generates 7 content pieces
   âœ… Creates 2 strategic playbooks
   âœ… Links everything together
5. User sees success message with folder location
6. User opens Memory Vault â†’ complete campaign package ready
```

## What Problems This Solves

### Problem 1: Schema Mismatch âœ… FIXED
**Before**: Framework had nested structure, content generator expected flat structure
**After**: Framework includes both - nested for planning, flat (`contentStrategy`) for content

### Problem 2: Invalid Content Types âœ… FIXED
**Before**: Framework suggested "Executive blog post", "White paper" (not real content types)
**After**: Framework only suggests actual MCP content type IDs: `press-release`, `media-pitch`, etc.

### Problem 3: Creative vs Executable âœ… FIXED
**Before**: No separation - either auto-generate everything or nothing
**After**: Clear separation:
- **Auto-Executable**: 7 content types generated immediately
- **Strategic Campaigns**: Detailed playbooks for high-impact manual execution

### Problem 4: No Orchestration âœ… FIXED
**Before**: Framework saved but nothing happened
**After**: "Execute" button triggers full automated pipeline

### Problem 5: No Folder Organization âœ… FIXED
**Before**: Content scattered across Memory Vault
**After**: Everything organized in framework-specific folder with playbooks subfolder

## Example: Launch Workflow

**Framework Generated:**

```typescript
{
  strategy: { objective, narrative, rationale, urgency },
  tactics: { campaign_elements, immediate_actions, ... },
  intelligence: { key_findings, competitor_moves, ... },

  // NEW: Content-ready format
  contentStrategy: {
    subject: "AI Safety Platform Launch",
    narrative: "First-to-market AI safety solution...",
    target_audiences: ["Enterprise CIOs", "AI Researchers", "Regulators"],
    key_messages: [...],
    media_targets: ["TechCrunch", "VentureBeat", "Bloomberg"],
    timeline: "1 week prep, 2-3 weeks execution"
  },

  // NEW: Execution plan
  executionPlan: {
    autoExecutableContent: {
      contentTypes: ['press-release', 'media-pitch', 'qa-document',
                     'talking-points', 'social-post', 'email', 'media-list'],
      estimatedPieces: 7
    },
    strategicRecommendations: {
      campaigns: [
        {
          title: "Product Launch Event Series",
          type: "event",
          executionSteps: [...],
          platform_support: {
            generatable_assets: ['event-invitation-email',
                                'event-announcement-press-release', ...]
          }
        },
        {
          title: "Influencer Unboxing Campaign",
          type: "partnership",
          executionSteps: [...],
          platform_support: {
            generatable_assets: ['influencer-pitch-email', ...]
          }
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**User Clicks "Execute Campaign":**

1. Framework saved to `strategic-frameworks/ai-safety-platform-launch/`
2. 7 content pieces auto-generated and saved
3. 2 playbooks created with step-by-step guides
4. Success message: "Campaign executed! 7 pieces generated, 2 playbooks created"

**In Memory Vault:**
