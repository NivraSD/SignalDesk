# Simplified Intelligence Flow

## Current (Confusing) Flow:
```
User → Frontend → Edge Functions → Maybe Save to DB → Maybe Load from DB → Maybe Cache → Display?
```

## Simplified Flow:
```
User → Run Analysis → Display Results
```

## How it Should Work:

### 1. Running Analysis:
- Click "Run Analysis" 
- See real-time progress
- Get results displayed immediately
- (Background: auto-save to Supabase)

### 2. Viewing Previous Analysis:
- Open app
- See your last analysis immediately
- Option to run fresh analysis if needed

## The Real Issue:
The pipeline is completing but not showing results because:
1. Data is being saved to Supabase ✅
2. Edge functions are working ✅  
3. But the frontend is looking for data in the wrong place ❌

## Quick Fix:

### Option 1: Direct Display (Simplest)
Just show the results as soon as they're generated, forget about complex storage for now:

```javascript
// When pipeline completes
const results = synthesizeResults(stageData);
setFinalIntelligence(results);
// Display immediately, save in background if needed
```

### Option 2: Simple Storage
Use Supabase's built-in client instead of edge functions:

```javascript
import { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'

// Save
await supabase.from('analysis').insert({ 
  org: 'Nike', 
  data: analysisResults 
})

// Load
const { data } = await supabase
  .from('analysis')
  .select('*')
  .eq('org', 'Nike')
  .single()
```

## What You Should Do Now:

1. **Test if analysis actually completes:**
   - Open browser console
   - Run the pipeline
   - Look for "ELABORATE PIPELINE COMPLETE"
   - Check if `finalIntelligence` has data

2. **If data exists but doesn't display:**
   - The issue is just the display logic
   - The render functions need the right data structure

3. **If you want to start fresh:**
   - Clear all localStorage
   - Clear browser cache
   - Focus on just getting results to display first
   - Add storage later

## The Real Real Issue:
We're overengineering this. The analysis works, it just needs to display properly!
