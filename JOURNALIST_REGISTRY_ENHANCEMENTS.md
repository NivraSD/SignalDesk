# Journalist Registry Enhancements ✅

## What's New

### 1. AND Statement Handling ✅

The system now intelligently handles multi-keyword queries with AND, comma, or ampersand separators.

**Examples:**
- "AI and technology" → Queries both `artificial_intelligence` AND `technology` industries
- "crypto, fintech" → Queries both `cryptocurrency` AND `fintech` industries
- "healthcare & biotech" → Queries `healthcare` industry (biotech maps to healthcare)

**How it works:**
```typescript
// Input: "AI and technology and space"
//
// Step 1: Parse keywords
const keywords = focusArea.split(/\s+(?:and|&|,)\s+/)
// Result: ["AI", "technology", "space"]

// Step 2: Map to industries
industries = ["artificial_intelligence", "technology", "space"]

// Step 3: Query each industry
for (industry of industries) {
  const journalists = await queryRegistry(industry)
  allJournalists.push(...journalists)
}

// Step 4: Deduplicate and limit
return uniqueJournalists.slice(0, requestedCount)
```

### 2. Publication Tier & Metadata ✅

Every journalist result now includes rich outlet metadata for better targeting and prioritization.

**Outlet Metadata Fields:**
```typescript
{
  name: "Casey Newton",
  outlet: "Platformer",
  beat: "Tech Platforms & AI",
  outlet_metadata: {
    tier: "tier1",              // tier1, tier2
    category: "newsletter",      // elite, tech, business, newsletter, vertical
    influence_score: 8,          // 1-10 scale
    reach: "global"             // global, national, regional
  }
}
```

**Outlet Categories:**

**Elite (Influence: 10):**
- New York Times
- Bloomberg
- Wall Street Journal
- Washington Post
- Reuters

**Tech (Influence: 8-9):**
- The Verge
- TechCrunch
- Wired
- The Information
- Ars Technica
- MIT Tech Review

**Business (Influence: 8-9):**
- Forbes
- Fortune
- CNBC

**Newsletter (Influence: 8):**
- Platformer
- Big Technology
- Semafor
- Puck

**Vertical (Influence: 8-9):**
- STAT News (Healthcare)
- CoinDesk (Crypto)
- The Block (Crypto)
- Axios (Business/Tech)
- Vox (Media)

## Industry Mapping

The system intelligently maps common terms to database industry names:

| User Query | Maps To |
|------------|---------|
| "AI" | artificial_intelligence |
| "tech" | technology |
| "crypto" | cryptocurrency |
| "blockchain" | cryptocurrency |
| "healthcare" | healthcare |
| "biotech" | healthcare |
| "climate" | climate |
| "sustainability" | climate |
| "cars" | automotive |
| "ev" | automotive |
| "ecommerce" | retail |
| "vc" | venture_capital |
| "private equity" | venture_capital |
| "security" | cybersecurity |
| "aerospace" | space |
| "workplace" | labor |
| "agriculture" | food |
| "regulation" | policy |
| "economy" | business |

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Single Industry
```
User: "Give me 10 AI journalists"

System Processing:
1. Parse: "AI" → artificial_intelligence
2. Query journalist_registry WHERE industry = 'artificial_intelligence'
3. Found: 8 journalists
4. Gap detected: 2 missing
5. Fill gaps with mcp-media web search
6. Return: 8 verified + 2 web-searched

Result:
- Will Knight (Wired) - AI & Machine Learning [Elite, Score: 9]
- Karen Hao (WSJ) - AI & Ethics [Elite, Score: 10]
- Melissa Heikkilä (MIT TR) - AI [Tech, Score: 9]
... (8 verified journalists with outlet metadata)
```

### Example 2: Multi-Industry with AND
```
User: "Give me 15 AI and space journalists"

System Processing:
1. Parse: "AI and space" → ["AI", "space"]
2. Map: ["artificial_intelligence", "space"]
3. Query artificial_intelligence: 8 journalists
4. Query space: 5 journalists
5. Combine & deduplicate: 13 unique journalists
6. Gap detected: 2 missing
7. Fill gaps with mcp-media
8. Return: 13 verified + 2 web-searched

Result:
- Will Knight (Wired) - AI [Tech, Score: 9]
- Eric Berger (Ars Technica) - Space [Tech, Score: 8]
- Joey Roulette (NYT) - Space [Elite, Score: 10]
... (13 verified journalists from 2 industries)
```

### Example 3: Beat Search Fallback
```
User: "Give me 10 cryptocurrency policy journalists"

System Processing:
1. Parse: "cryptocurrency policy" → keywords don't map cleanly
2. Try keyword matching: found "crypto" → cryptocurrency
3. Try keyword matching: found "policy" → policy
4. Query cryptocurrency: 8 journalists
5. Query policy: 6 journalists
6. Filter by beat: journalists covering crypto policy
7. Result: 5 journalists who cover crypto AND policy

Result:
- Nikhilesh De (CoinDesk) - Crypto Policy [Vertical, Score: 8]
- Danny Nelson (CoinDesk) - Crypto & Policy [Vertical, Score: 8]
... (journalists covering the intersection)
```

## Gap Detection Flow

Similar to mcp-discovery, the system detects when the database lacks sufficient journalists:

```
1. User requests: 20 journalists
2. Database returns: 8 journalists
3. Gap detected: 12 missing

Gap Analysis:
{
  hasGaps: true,
  currentCount: 8,
  requestedCount: 20,
  missingCount: 12,
  suggestions: [
    "Found 8 verified journalists from database",
    "Filling 12 gaps with web search",
    "Search web for additional {industry} journalists",
    "Look for freelance {industry} reporters"
  ]
}

4. Call mcp-media to fill 12 gaps
5. Return: 8 verified + 12 web-searched = 20 total
```

## Benefits

### Before:
❌ "AI and technology" would search for industry "ai_and_technology,_education" (no results)
❌ No publication quality metadata
❌ Couldn't distinguish between NYT (elite) and niche blog

### After:
✅ "AI and technology" queries both industries, combines results
✅ Every journalist includes outlet metadata (tier, category, influence, reach)
✅ Can filter/prioritize by publication quality:
   - Elite outlets (NYT, WSJ, Bloomberg): Influence 10
   - Top tech (Wired, Verge): Influence 9
   - Vertical specialists (STAT, CoinDesk): Influence 8-9

## Testing

```bash
# Test AND statements
node test-and-statements.js

# Test cases:
# ✅ Single keyword: "AI"
# ✅ AND statement: "AI and technology"
# ✅ Comma separated: "crypto, fintech"
# ✅ Ampersand: "healthcare & biotech"
# ✅ Complex: "AI and space and climate"
```
