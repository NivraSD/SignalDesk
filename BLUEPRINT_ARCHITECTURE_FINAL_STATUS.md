# Blueprint Architecture - Final Status

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Session Summary:** Built capability-based blueprint architecture with psychological influence mapping

---

## ‚úÖ What Was Completed

### 1. Influence Mapper (FULLY WORKING)
**File:** `supabase/functions/niv-blueprint-influence-mapper/index.ts`
- Combines stakeholder psychology + positioning ‚Üí influence strategies
- Performance: 33 seconds
- Output quality: Excellent (deep psychological insights, positioning integrated)
- **Ready for production**

### 2. Tactical Phases 1-2 (WORKING WITH RETRY)
**File:** `supabase/functions/niv-blueprint-tactical-phases-1-2/index.ts`
- Generates awareness + consideration phases
- All 4 pillars (Owned, Relationships, Events, Media)
- Performance: ~60 seconds
- **Has retry logic for JSON parsing (up to 3 attempts)**

### 3. Tactical Phases 3-4 (WORKING WITH RETRY)
**File:** `supabase/functions/niv-blueprint-tactical-phases-3-4/index.ts`
- Generates conversion + advocacy phases
- All 4 pillars
- Performance: ~60 seconds (parallel with 1-2)
- **Has retry logic for JSON parsing (up to 3 attempts)**

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Designed

### Capability-Based Functions (not section-based)
1. ‚úÖ Influence Mapper - Maps psychology to positioning
2. ‚úÖ Tactical Phases 1-2 - Generates early phases
3. ‚úÖ Tactical Phases 3-4 - Generates late phases
4. ‚è∏Ô∏è Pattern Selector - Selects campaign pattern
5. ‚è∏Ô∏è Scenario Planner - Counter-narrative responses
6. ‚è∏Ô∏è Resource Calculator - Bandwidth/budget estimates
7. ‚è∏Ô∏è Main Orchestrator - Coordinates all functions

### Key Design Decisions
- **Split tactical generation** into 2 parallel functions (avoids timeouts)
- **Retry logic** handles Claude's occasional JSON syntax errors
- **Psychological depth** via influence mapping
- **Structured requests** not content (for niv-content-intelligent-v2)

## üìä Performance Metrics

| Function | Time | Status |
|----------|------|--------|
| Influence Mapper | 33s | ‚úÖ Stable |
| Tactical Phases 1-2 | ~60s | ‚úÖ With retry |
| Tactical Phases 3-4 | ~60s | ‚úÖ With retry |
| **Parallel Total** | **~60s** | ‚úÖ Under timeout |

**vs Current:** Single blueprint = 120+ seconds, frequent timeouts

## üîß What Still Needs Building

### Priority 1: Complete Blueprint Generation
1. **Pattern Selector** (~5-10 seconds)
   - Select pattern (CASCADE, MIRROR, CHORUS, etc.)
   - Simple decision tree logic

2. **Main Orchestrator** (~70-80s total)
   - Call functions in parallel
   - Compile into 6-part blueprint
   - Handle errors gracefully

### Priority 2: Supporting Functions
3. **Scenario Planner** (~10-15 seconds)
   - Generate 3-5 threat scenarios
   - Response playbooks

4. **Resource Calculator** (~5 seconds)
   - Count content pieces
   - Estimate bandwidth/budget

## üéØ Key Achievements

1. **Avoided Timeouts:** Split approach keeps functions under 60s
2. **Psychological Depth:** Influence mapper successfully combines research + positioning
3. **Retry Logic:** Handles Claude's JSON generation variance
4. **Clean Architecture:** Capability-based, not section-based
5. **Parallel Execution:** Reduces total time by 40-50%

---

## üöÄ Next Steps to Complete

### To Get Working End-to-End:
1. Build simple pattern selector (1 hour)
2. Build main orchestrator (2 hours)
3. Test complete pipeline: Research ‚Üí Positioning ‚Üí Blueprint
4. Fix any remaining issues

### To Get Production-Ready:
5. Build scenario planner and resource calculator
6. Add progress tracking to UI
7. Test integration with niv-content-intelligent-v2
8. Add error handling and fallbacks

**Estimated time to working MVP:** 3-4 hours
**Estimated time to production-ready:** 6-8 hours

## üí° Key Insights

### What Worked:
- Splitting tactical generation into 2 parallel functions
- Influence mapping with psychological depth
- Retry logic for JSON parsing stability

### What Was Different Than Expected:
- Claude generates malformed JSON inconsistently (hence retry logic)
- Phases 3-4 aren't inherently different from 1-2, just variance in generation
- Parallel execution is critical for performance

### What to Watch:
- JSON parsing stability (retry logic should handle it)
- Token limits if we add more complexity
- Integration with niv-content-intelligent-v2

## üîë Critical Files

```typescript
// Edge Functions (deployed)
supabase/functions/niv-blueprint-influence-mapper/index.ts
supabase/functions/niv-blueprint-tactical-phases-1-2/index.ts
supabase/functions/niv-blueprint-tactical-phases-3-4/index.ts

// Test Files
test-influence-mapper.js
test-tactical-phases-parallel.js

// Output Examples

```

## Bottom Line

**Status:** Core blueprint generation architecture is built and working. Influence mapping produces excellent quality. Tactical generation works with retry logic. Ready to build orchestrator and complete the system.

**Risk Level:** Low - Architecture validated, timeouts avoided, retry logic in place

**Recommendation:** Continue building pattern selector + orchestrator to get end-to-end working
