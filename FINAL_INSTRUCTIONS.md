# ✅ MCP Fix Complete!

## What Was Fixed

1. **Database Schema** ✅
   - Added missing `objectives` and `user_id` columns to campaigns table
   - memoryvault_items table already had required columns

2. **Console Output Removed** ✅
   - Removed all console.log statements that were breaking JSON-RPC
   - MCPs now output only valid JSON-RPC responses

3. **Database Connection Fixed** ✅
   - Updated all MCPs with correct Supabase password
   - Using correct connection string: `postgresql://postgres:habku2-gotraf-suVhan@db.zskaxjtyuaqazydouifp.supabase.co:5432/postgres`
   - Database connection verified (3 rows in memoryvault_items, 0 in campaigns)

## All MCPs Built Successfully ✅
- signaldesk-memory ✅
- signaldesk-campaigns ✅
- signaldesk-media ✅

## Final Step: Restart Claude Desktop

1. **Completely quit Claude Desktop** (Cmd+Q on Mac)
2. **Wait 5 seconds**
3. **Reopen Claude Desktop**

## Testing in Claude Desktop

Once restarted, test your MCPs by typing these commands in Claude:

### Test Memory MCP:
- "Add a test memory about our project goals"
- "Search memory for project"
- "List memory categories"

### Test Campaigns MCP:
- "Create a new PR campaign called 'Test Campaign' with objectives"
- "Get campaign status"

### Test Media MCP:
- "Find journalists who write about technology"
- "Create a media list for tech writers"

## What You Should See

✅ **Success**: MCPs respond with data or confirmation messages
❌ **If still errors**: Check Claude Desktop Developer Tools (View → Toggle Developer Tools) for detailed error messages

## Troubleshooting

If MCPs still don't work after restart:

1. **Check Claude Desktop config**: Make sure your `.claude/claude_desktop_config.json` has the correct paths to the MCP dist/index.js files

2. **Verify paths**:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "signaldesk-memory": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/Users/jonathanliebowitz/Desktop/SignalDesk/mcp-servers/signaldesk-memory/dist/index.js"]
       },
       "signaldesk-campaigns": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/Users/jonathanliebowitz/Desktop/SignalDesk/mcp-servers/signaldesk-campaigns/dist/index.js"]
       },
       "signaldesk-media": {
         "command": "node",
         "args": ["/Users/jonathanliebowitz/Desktop/SignalDesk/mcp-servers/signaldesk-media/dist/index.js"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **If paths are wrong**, update them and restart Claude Desktop again
