# SignalDesk V2 Platform Update - January 2025

## Executive Summary

SignalDesk has evolved from a traditional PR tool into an **intelligent orchestration platform** powered by Claude AI and 17 specialized MCP servers. The platform now features real-time intelligence gathering, predictive opportunity detection, and autonomous content generation - all orchestrated through Niv, our AI strategic advisor.

**Key Transformation**: From feature-centric platform to **Niv-first orchestration system** where AI is the primary interface, supported by MemoryVault persistent intelligence and 17 specialized MCP agents.

## Core Foundation Architecture

The platform is built on four interconnected pillars:

1. **Onboarding System** ‚Üí Captures initial context
2. **MemoryVault** ‚Üí Stores and organizes everything permanently  
3. **MCP Integration** ‚Üí Gathers real-time intelligence
4. **Opportunity Engine** ‚Üí Detects and scores opportunities

```
Onboarding ‚Üí Stores in ‚Üí MemoryVault
     ‚Üì              ‚Üë
Configures Feeds
     ‚Üì              ‚Üë  
MCP Integration ‚Üí Discovers ‚Üí Opportunity Engine
```

### MemoryVault: The Persistent Intelligence Brain

```javascript
MemoryVault {
  // Company Context (from Onboarding)
  organization: {
    profile, objectives, differentiators,
    competitors, stakeholders
  },

  // Intelligence History (from MCPs)
  intelligence: {
    patterns, cascade_effects, successful_responses,
    competitor_moves, market_changes
  },

  // Campaign Performance (from Execution)  
  campaigns: {
    templates, successful_pitches, media_relationships,
    content_that_worked, timing_patterns
  },

  // Opportunity Patterns (from Engine)
  opportunities: {
    detected, acted_upon, outcomes,
    window_timings, success_factors
  }
}
```
