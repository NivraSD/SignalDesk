# Niv Routes Explained - Which One to Use?

You have 3 Niv interfaces available:

## 1. `/niv-simple` 
**Status:** ❓ Depends on Edge Function  
**What it does:** Original attempt at simplified Niv interface  
**Uses:** Edge Function `niv-simple`  
**Problem:** Complex Edge Function that might not be working

## 2. `/niv-realtime`
**Status:** ❌ Won't work  
**What it does:** Attempted to use Realtime subscriptions  
**Problem:** Realtime is not available on your Supabase plan  
**Don't use this one**

## 3. `/niv-database` 
**Status:** ✅ WORKING - USE THIS ONE!  
**What it does:** Direct database operations (no Realtime needed)  
**Uses:** Edge Function `niv-database` (which we just fixed)  
**This is the one that should work now!**

## Test The Working Version

1. **Open:** http://localhost:3000/niv-database

2. **Test it by typing:**
   - "I need a PR strategy for my startup"
   - "Help me create a media list"
   - "I need a strategic framework for product launch"

3. **What should happen:**
   - Chat messages appear immediately
   - Messages are saved to database
   - When you mention "strategy", artifacts may be created
   - Everything works without Realtime

## Clean Up (Optional)

If you want to remove the non-working routes to avoid confusion:

1. Edit `/frontend/src/App.js`
2. Remove or comment out:
   ```javascript
   // <Route path="/niv-simple" element={<NivSimple />} />
   // <Route path="/niv-realtime" element={<NivRealtime />} />
   ```
3. Keep only:
   ```javascript
   <Route path="/niv-database" element={<NivDatabase />} />
   ```

## Summary

✅ **USE:** http://localhost:3000/niv-database  
❌ **DON'T USE:** `/niv-simple` or `/niv-realtime`

The `/niv-database` route is the working solution that bypasses all the Realtime issues and works with the Edge Function we just deployed.
