# NIV "Democratize" Cliché Fix - Complete

## Problem Identified

NIV (both `niv-orchestrator-robust` and `niv-content-intelligent-v2`) was consistently using "democratize..." in strategic options because:

1. **Claude's training data bias**: Tech industry PR/marketing heavily uses "democratizing X" as a go-to phrase
2. **Pattern matching**: Claude defaults to common tech industry patterns when generating strategic approaches
3. **No explicit guardrails**: System prompts didn't prohibit generic buzzwords

**Example from logs:**
- "Democratizing AI for developers"
- "Democratizing video creation"
- "Democratizing access to X"

These phrases are meaningless because they:
- Apply to literally any tech product
- Provide no differentiation
- Sound like every other tech company
- Don't communicate actual value

## Solution Implemented

### Updated System Prompts in Both Functions

**Files Modified:**
1. `/supabase/functions/niv-content-intelligent-v2/system-prompt.ts` (lines 89-114)
2. `/supabase/functions/niv-orchestrator-robust/index.ts` (lines 416-438)

**Added Section: "CRITICAL - AVOID TECH INDUSTRY CLICHÉS"**

### Banned Phrases:
- ❌ "Democratizing X" / "Democratize"
- ❌ "Disrupting X" / "Disrupt"
- ❌ "Revolutionizing X" / "Game-changer"
- ❌ "Paradigm shift"
- ❌ "Synergy" / "Synergistic"
- ❌ "Leverage" (as a verb)
- ❌ "Best-in-class" / "World-class"
- ❌ "Cutting-edge" / "Bleeding-edge"
- ❌ "Next-generation" / "Next-gen"
- ❌ "Transforming X" (unless genuinely transformative with proof)

### Required Approach - Be SPECIFIC:

**Bad Examples (Generic):**
```
❌ "Democratizing AI for developers"
❌ "Disrupting the video creation space"
❌ "Next-generation platform"
```

**Good Examples (Specific & Differentiated):**
```
✅ "Making enterprise-grade AI accessible to independent developers through simplified APIs"
✅ "Shifting professional video production from $50K studio setups to $50/month software"
✅ "First platform to combine real-time collaboration with AI-powered editing"
```

### Key Instruction Added:
> "Your strategic options must be UNIQUE to this specific company, product, and market context - not generic buzzwords that could apply to anyone."

## Impact

### Before ❌

1. Democratizing video creation...
2. Disrupting the content industry...
3. Next-generation AI platform..."
```

### After ✅
```
NIV: "I see 3 narrative approaches:
1. Reducing professional video production costs from $50K to $500 per project
2. Making studio-quality AI video accessible without technical expertise
3. First AI video tool to maintain full creative control while automating technical work"
```

## Why This Matters

### Strategic Differentiation
- Generic buzzwords don't differentiate products
- Specific value propositions win in the market
- Real outcomes > vague claims

### Trust & Credibility
- "Democratize" has become a red flag for empty marketing
- Specific claims are verifiable and credible
- Executives prefer concrete value to buzzwords

### Better Content Output
- More compelling press releases
- More effective media pitches
- More resonant strategic narratives
- Better audience targeting

## Testing

To test the fix, try asking NIV:
```
"I need a media plan for our new AI video tool launch"
```

**Expected behavior:**
- NIV will research the market
- Present 3 strategic options with SPECIFIC, differentiated positioning
- No "democratizing", "disrupting", or other banned buzzwords
- Each option tied to measurable outcomes or concrete differentiation
