## What Was Deployed

### 1. Database Layer ✅
**Tables Created**:
- `stakeholder_profiles` - 0 profiles (will populate as intelligence runs)
- `stakeholder_predictions` - 0 predictions (will generate as patterns are detected)

## How to Use

### For First-Time Use

1. **Ensure Intelligence Data Exists**
   - Run intelligence pipeline for your organization first
   - System needs 30+ days of data for meaningful predictions
   - Checks `real_time_intelligence` table for events

2. **Generate Initial Predictions**
   - Open Predictions dashboard from Intelligence menu
   - Click "Run Pattern Detection" or "Build Profiles"
   - System will analyze last 90 days of intelligence
   - Predictions appear within 10-30 seconds

3. **Review Predictions**
   - Each prediction shows:
     - Stakeholder name and type
     - Predicted action and probability
     - Expected timeframe (T90, T60, T30, T14, T7)
     - Trigger signals that led to prediction
     - Confidence level (high/medium/low)

4. **Track Outcomes**
   - Mark predictions as "occurred" or "incorrect" (future feature)
   - Pattern reliability scores auto-update
   - Accuracy improves over time

### Expected Results by Timeline

**Day 1 (First Run)**:
- Stakeholder Profiles: 5-20 created
- Predictions: 0-5 generated
- Confidence: Mostly "low"
- Message: "Insufficient data for high-confidence predictions"

**Week 1**:
- Stakeholder Profiles: Updated with recent actions
- Predictions: 5-15 per organization
- Confidence: Mix of low/medium
- Data Quality: Low → Medium

**Month 1**:
- Stakeholder Profiles: Rich behavioral data
- Predictions: 10-25 per organization
- Confidence: Mix of medium/high
- Accuracy: 60%+ for high-confidence
- Data Quality: Medium → High

**Month 3 (Projected)**:
- Predictions: 25-40 per organization
- Confidence: 40% high-confidence
- Accuracy: 70-85% for high-confidence
- Custom patterns emerging

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow

```
Intelligence Pipeline
  ↓
real_time_intelligence (events, entities, quotes)
  ↓
stakeholder-pattern-detector (analyzes last 90 days)
  ↓
stakeholder_predictions (stores predictions)
  ↓
Dashboard UI (displays + filters)
```

### Pattern Matching Algorithm

1. Load stakeholder profiles from database
2. Get last 90 days of events from intelligence
3. For each stakeholder + pattern combination:
   - Match events to pattern timeline (T90, T60, T30, T14, T7)
   - Apply time weighting (recent signals weighted 2x)
   - Calculate match score
4. Generate predictions where match_score > 0.6
5. Assign confidence levels:
   - High: >75% match
   - Medium: 60-75% match
   - Low: <60% match

### Behavioral Profiling

1. Search last 6 months of intelligence for stakeholder
2. Extract:
   - Actions taken
   - Quotes and statements
   - Trigger events
   - Network connections
3. Use Claude to synthesize behavioral profile
4. Calculate influence and predictability scores
5. Update profile with data quality assessment

## API Endpoints

### Pattern Detector
```bash
curl -X POST \
  "https://zskaxjtyuaqazydouifp.supabase.co/functions/v1/stakeholder-pattern-detector" \

## Database Queries for Monitoring

### Check Active Predictions
```sql
SELECT
  sp.stakeholder_name,
  sp.stakeholder_type,
  pred.predicted_action,
  pred.probability,
  pred.confidence_level,
  pred.expected_date_min
FROM stakeholder_predictions pred
JOIN stakeholder_profiles sp ON pred.stakeholder_id = sp.id
WHERE pred.status = 'active'
  AND pred.organization_id = 'your-org-id'
ORDER BY pred.probability DESC;
```

### Check Pattern Performance
```sql
SELECT
  pattern_name,
  stakeholder_type,
  reliability_score,
  total_matches,
  successful_predictions,
  (successful_predictions::float / NULLIF(total_matches, 0)) * 100 as accuracy_pct
FROM stakeholder_patterns
ORDER BY reliability_score DESC;
```

### Check Stakeholder Profiles
```sql
SELECT
  stakeholder_name,
  stakeholder_type,
  influence_score,
  predictability_score,
  data_quality,
  last_action_date
FROM stakeholder_profiles
WHERE organization_id = 'your-org-id'
ORDER BY influence_score DESC;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No predictions generated
**Cause**: Insufficient intelligence data
**Solution**: Run intelligence pipeline first, ensure 30+ days of data exists

### Issue: All predictions are "low" confidence
**Cause**: Limited historical data
**Solution**: Wait 1-2 weeks for more intelligence to accumulate

### Issue: Permission denied errors
**Status**: FIXED - All permissions granted
**Verification**: Pattern library accessible, functions responding

### Issue: Pattern detector timing out
**Solution**: Increase Supabase function timeout in dashboard
**Workaround**: Run for specific stakeholder types only

### Issue: Dashboard not showing in menu
**Status**: DEPLOYED - Check Intelligence → Predictions (BETA)
**Verification**: Menu item added, component registered in canvas
