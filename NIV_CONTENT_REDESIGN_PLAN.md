# NIV Content Assistant - Complete Redesign Plan

## THE CORE PROBLEM
The current NIV Content Assistant is fundamentally broken:
1. **NOT CONNECTED TO CLAUDE** - It's just spitting out hardcoded prompts
2. **NOT CONVERSATIONAL** - Zero awareness of what the user is saying
3. **NOT RESPONSIVE** - Doesn't actually listen or adapt to user input
4. **FAKE INTELLIGENCE** - Pretends to be smart but it's just templates

## WHAT NIV CONTENT SHOULD BE

### Core Identity
NIV is a **CONVERSATIONAL AI CONTENT SPECIALIST** that:
- **LISTENS** to what the user wants
- **ASKS** intelligent follow-up questions
- **UNDERSTANDS** context from the conversation
- **CREATES** content based on the actual discussion
- **REMEMBERS** the conversation history
- **ADAPTS** based on user feedback

### Key Behaviors
1. **Real Conversation** - Like talking to a human content strategist
2. **Context Aware** - Remembers what was discussed earlier
3. **Intelligent Questions** - Asks RELEVANT follow-ups, not generic templates
4. **Fast Response** - Under 2 seconds for conversation, 5-10 seconds for generation
5. **Content Expert** - Knows how to create each content type properly

## THE ARCHITECTURE THAT ACTUALLY WORKS

### 1. Real Claude Integration
```typescript
// Every message goes through Claude - NO HARDCODED RESPONSES
const claudeResponse = await fetch('/api/claude-direct', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    messages: fullConversationHistory, // FULL CONTEXT
    system: NIV_CONTENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT // Rich personality
  })
})

// ACTUALLY USE THE RESPONSE
const nivResponse = await claudeResponse.json()
addMessage(nivResponse.content) // ADD TO CONVERSATION
```

### 2. Conversation State Management
```typescript
interface ConversationState {
  // Track EVERYTHING
  messages: Message[]
  currentIntent: 'exploring' | 'clarifying' | 'generating' | 'refining'
  contentContext: {
    type?: ContentType
    purpose?: string
    audience?: string
    tone?: string
    keyPoints?: string[]
    constraints?: string[]
  }
  userPreferences: {
    wants: string[]
    doesNotWant: string[]
  }
}
```

### 3. NIV's System Prompt
```
You are NIV, a senior content strategist with 15 years experience creating compelling content.

CORE BEHAVIORS:
1. CONVERSATIONAL - Talk naturally, like a colleague helping with content
2. RESPONSIVE - Directly address what the user says, don't ignore them
3. INTELLIGENT - Ask smart follow-ups based on what they tell you
4. EFFICIENT - Get to content creation quickly, don't over-question
5. ADAPTIVE - Change approach based on user feedback

CONVERSATION FLOW:
- User says what they want → Acknowledge it specifically
- Ask 1-2 RELEVANT questions (not generic templates)
- User provides info → Build on it, ask for missing pieces
- Have enough context → Offer to generate
- User wants changes → Make them immediately

NEVER:
- Ignore what the user said
- Ask generic template questions
- Pretend to do something you're not doing
- Take more than 2-3 exchanges before offering to generate
```

### 4. Content Generation Flow

#### STEP 1: User Input
```
User: "I need a press release about our new AI product launch"
```

#### STEP 2: NIV Acknowledges & Asks RELEVANT Questions
```
NIV: "Great! I'll help you create a compelling press release for your AI product launch.

To make this impactful, tell me:
- What makes this AI product unique or groundbreaking?
- Are you targeting technical audiences or general business readers?

Share what you can, and I'll create a strong announcement."
```

#### STEP 3: User Provides Context
```
User: "It's an AI assistant for lawyers. Revolutionary accuracy. Target legal tech journalists."
```

#### STEP 4: NIV Generates WITH CONTEXT
```
NIV: "Perfect - an AI assistant for lawyers with breakthrough accuracy, targeting legal tech media. I'll create a press release that emphasizes the innovation and practical impact. Generating now..."

[ACTUALLY GENERATES BASED ON CONVERSATION]
```

## IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

### Phase 1: Gut the Broken System
1. Delete all hardcoded message templates
2. Remove fake "gatherMoreContext" that does nothing
3. Strip out the pretend intelligence

### Phase 2: Build Real Claude Connection
1. Create proper conversation history management
2. Implement system prompt with personality
3. Actually use Claude responses in UI

### Phase 3: Content Generation Pipeline
1. Fast path for simple requests (< 5 seconds)
2. Research path when explicitly requested (30-60 seconds)
3. Real-time feedback and refinement

### Phase 4: Testing Scenarios
1. "Write a tweet about our product" → Should ask what product, what angle
2. "Make it more professional" → Should actually modify the content
3. "I don't like it" → Should ask what to change specifically
4. "Create a press release for OpenAI's new model" → Should ask for details about the model

## SUCCESS CRITERIA
- [ ] NIV responds to ACTUAL user input, not templates
- [ ] Conversation feels natural, not scripted
- [ ] Content is generated based on conversation context
- [ ] Fast responses (< 2 seconds for chat)
- [ ] User can refine content through conversation
- [ ] NIV remembers earlier parts of conversation

## FILES TO MODIFY/CREATE

1. **DELETE**: `/src/components/execute/NIVContentAssistantConversational.tsx` (it's unsalvageable)

2. **CREATE**: `/src/components/execute/NIVContentChat.tsx`
   - Real Claude integration
   - Proper conversation state
   - Actual message handling

3. **CREATE**: `/src/lib/niv-content-system.ts`
   - NIV's personality and system prompt
   - Conversation management logic
   - Intent detection

4. **UPDATE**: `/src/components/execute/ExecuteTabSplitView.tsx`
   - Use new NIVContentChat component
   - Remove broken component references

## THE DIFFERENCE

### CURRENT (BROKEN)
```
User: "I need a press release"
NIV: [HARDCODED] "I'll help you create a press release. Answer these 4 questions..."
User: "It's about our new product"
NIV: [IGNORES USER] "Please tell me: 1. What is the news? 2. Who is the audience?..."
User: "Just make something"
NIV: [STILL TEMPLATED] "I need more information..."
```

### NEW (WORKING)
```
User: "I need a press release"
NIV: "I'll help you create a press release. What's the announcement about?"
User: "It's about our new product"
NIV: "Tell me about this new product - what does it do and why is it significant?"
User: "It's an AI coding assistant that's 10x faster"
NIV: "That's a strong angle - 10x faster AI coding. Who should we target - developers, CTOs, or broader tech media? And do you have any metrics or customer quotes?"
User: "Target developers, no quotes yet"
NIV: "Got it. Creating a developer-focused press release highlighting the 10x speed improvement. Generating now..."
[CREATES ACTUAL CONTENT BASED ON CONVERSATION]
```

## NEXT STEPS
1. Confirm this plan captures the vision
2. Delete the broken implementation
3. Build it right from scratch
4. Test with real conversations
5. Ensure it's ACTUALLY talking to Claude and ACTUALLY responsive
