# SignalDesk Platform Status Report
*Generated: August 18, 2025*

## Executive Summary

After 24+ hours of intensive development and debugging, the SignalDesk Niv AI PR strategist system has been fundamentally rebuilt with intelligent multi-mode functionality. The core artifact creation problem has been solved, and the system now operates as originally envisioned.

## Core Problem Solved

### Before (Broken Behavior)
- **Every message created artifacts** - even simple questions like "What do you think about Friday announcements?"
- **Artifacts were often empty** due to data structure mismatches
- **No strategic awareness** - treated all content the same way
- **User frustration** - "honestly. you fucking suck and have no clue what i want"

### After (Fixed Behavior)
- **Quick advice mode**: No artifacts unless explicitly requested
- **Single deliverable mode**: One professional artifact for content requests
- **Complete package mode**: Multiple linked artifacts for comprehensive PR packages
- **Explicit control**: Users say "save this" to force artifact creation

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Infrastructure
- **Primary Backend**: Vercel serverless functions (`backend-orchestrator`)
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with real-time subscriptions
- **AI Engine**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet (claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage for file management

### Multi-Mode Intelligence System

#### Scope Detection Algorithm
```javascript
// Intelligent intent detection
const indicators = {
  quick: ['think', 'advice', 'should i', 'what do you'],      // No artifacts
  single: ['write a', 'create a', 'draft a', 'need a'],       // One artifact  
  package: ['everything', 'complete package', 'launching'],   // Multiple artifacts
  analysis: ['analyze', 'assess', 'review', 'evaluate']       // Strategic analysis
};
```

#### Artifact Decision Logic
- **Quick Mode**: Only creates artifacts if user says "save this"
- **Single Mode**: Always creates one professional deliverable
- **Package Mode**: Creates comprehensive PR package with multiple components
- **Analysis Mode**: Creates artifacts for substantial strategic analysis

## Current System Capabilities

### ✅ Working Features

**1. Intelligent Scope Detection**
- Automatically determines user intent from message content
- Scales response complexity appropriately (500-4000 tokens)
- Maintains conversation context and continuity

**2. Multi-Mode Response System**
- **Quick Advice**: Concise guidance without artifacts
- **Single Deliverables**: Professional press releases, media lists, statements
- **Complete Packages**: Full PR campaigns with multiple components
- **Strategic Analysis**: In-depth evaluation with actionable insights

**3. Explicit Artifact Control**
- Users control artifact creation with "save this" commands
- Strategic content suggestions without auto-saving
- Clear indication when content has strategic value

**4. Frontend Integration**
- Real-time chat interface with Niv AI strategist
- Workspace panel for artifact management and editing
- Responsive design with mobile compatibility
- Conversation persistence and history

**5. Backend Orchestration**
- Vercel serverless functions for scalability
- CORS-enabled API endpoints for cross-origin requests
- Error handling and fallback responses
- Session management and user context

### 🚧 Partially Implemented Features

**1. MCP Server Integration**
- **Framework Ready**: 11+ MCP servers designed and specified
- **Missing**: Actual server implementations and connections
- **Planned**: Crisis, Social, Narratives, Stakeholder Groups, Regulatory, Entities, Orchestrator

**2. Opportunity Engine**
- **Concept**: AI-driven PR opportunity detection
- **Status**: Mock implementation with basic triggers
- **Needed**: Real-time monitoring and intelligence gathering

**3. Component Type Detection**
- **Issue**: Media lists sometimes open as content drafts
- **Status**: Frontend routing inconsistencies
- **Impact**: Minor UI confusion, content still accessible

### ❌ Known Issues

**1. Vercel Deployment Delays**
- New API endpoints sometimes take time to deploy
- Workaround: Updated existing endpoint with new logic
- Status: Monitoring deployment pipeline

**2. Structured Content Editing**
- Media lists display as text instead of editable lists
- Press releases work correctly with structured editing
- Impact: Reduced editing functionality for some content types

**3. MCP Server Connectivity**
- No real intelligence gathering from external sources yet
- Opportunity detection is currently mocked
- Strategic recommendations lack real-time market data
