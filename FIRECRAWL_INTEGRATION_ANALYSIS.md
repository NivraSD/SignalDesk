## Current State Analysis

### What We're Currently Using

#### Monitor Stage 1 (No Firecrawl)
- **RSS Feeds**: Primary source via master-source-registry
- **News API**: Supplemental coverage ($44/month plan)
- **Claude Assessment**: Intelligent filtering of 100+ articles
- **Cost**: ~$0.10-0.20 per pipeline run
- **Speed**: 10-15 seconds for article collection

#### Intelligence Extraction (Limited Firecrawl)
- **Usage**: Only for articles marked as `firecrawl_extracted`
- **Purpose**: Deep content extraction when RSS/API insufficient
- **Current Status**: Disabled for cost control during testing

---

## Component 1: Fireplexity - AI-Powered Search

### What It Is
Fireplexity is an **open-source AI search engine** built on Firecrawl that provides:
- Real-time web, news, and image search
- AI-powered contextualization with citations
- Streaming responses for instant results
- Source transparency

### Key Differentiators from Standard Firecrawl
1. **AI Integration**: Uses Groq/Claude for intelligent search synthesis
2. **Multi-Modal**: Searches web, news, images simultaneously
3. **Citation System**: Provides verifiable sources
4. **Streaming**: Real-time response generation
5. **Open Source**: Customizable and self-hostable

---

## Component 2: Firecrawl Observer - Predictive Monitoring

### What It Is
Firecrawl Observer is an **AI-powered website monitoring application** that provides:
- Intelligent change detection on any website
- AI-based significance filtering (only alerts for meaningful changes)
- Single page OR entire website monitoring
- Configurable monitoring intervals
- Real-time update notifications

### Game-Changing Use Cases

#### 1. Competitor Intelligence 🎯
Monitor competitors' websites for:
- **Product page updates** → New feature launches

### Observer vs Current Monitoring
```
Current (RSS/News API):
- Reactive: Only sees published content
- Limited: Can't detect website changes
- Delayed: Hours to days after events

With Observer:
- Proactive: Detects changes BEFORE press releases
- Comprehensive: Monitors entire websites
- Instant: Minutes after changes occur
```

## Technical Implementation

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Add to .env.local
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your_key
GROQ_API_KEY=your_key        # For Fireplexity AI
OBSERVER_API_KEY=your_key    # For Observer monitoring
```

### 2. NIV Orchestration Service
```typescript
// supabase/functions/niv-orchestrator/index.ts
export async function processWithNiv(query: string, context: ModuleContext) {
  // Determine which intelligence layers to use
  const layers = determineIntelligenceLayers(query, context);

  const results = await Promise.all([
    layers.baseline && getBaselineIntelligence(),
    layers.predictive && checkObserverAlerts(query),
    layers.realtime && searchWithFireplexity(query)
  ]);

  return synthesizeMultiLayerIntelligence(results);
}
```

### 3. Observer Integration
```typescript
// supabase/functions/observer-monitor/index.ts
export async function setupObserverMonitoring() {
  const targets = await getMonitoringTargets();

  for (const target of targets) {
    await observer.monitor({
      url: target.url,
      interval: target.interval,
      webhook: `${SUPABASE_URL}/functions/v1/observer-webhook`,
      aiFilter: {
        enabled: true,
        significance: target.significanceThreshold || 70
      }
    });
  }
}

// Webhook handler for Observer alerts
export async function handleObserverAlert(change: ChangeEvent) {
  // Feed into NIV for analysis
  const analysis = await analyzeWithNiv(change);

  if (analysis.isSignificant) {
    // Create opportunity
    await createOpportunityFromChange(change, analysis);
    // Alert relevant teams
    await notifyStakeholders(change, analysis);
  }
}
```

### 4. Fireplexity Real-Time Search
```typescript
// supabase/functions/niv-fireplexity/index.ts
export async function searchWithFireplexity(query: string) {
  const shouldUseFireplexity = (
    query.includes('urgent') ||
    query.includes('breaking') ||
    query.includes('crisis') ||
    query.includes('verify') ||
    query.includes('who is currently')
  );

  if (shouldUseFireplexity) {
    const results = await fireplexity.search({
      query,
      sources: ['web', 'news'],
      stream: true,
      includeImages: false
    });

    return {
      results,
      citations: results.sources,
      timestamp: new Date(),
      cost: trackUsage(query)
    };
  }

  return getCachedIntelligence(query);
}

---

## Cost Management Strategy

### Tiered Usage Model
1. **Free Tier**: Existing pipeline data (RSS/News API)
2. **Smart Tier**: Fireplexity for priority queries only
3. **Premium Tier**: Unlimited Fireplexity searches

### Query Routing Logic
```typescript
const shouldUseFireplexity = (query: string, user: User) => {
  // High-value triggers
  if (query.includes('urgent') || query.includes('breaking')) return true;
  if (query.includes('crisis') || query.includes('threat')) return true;

  // Module-specific
  if (module === 'execute' && query.includes('journalist')) return true;
  if (module === 'opportunities' && query.includes('validate')) return true;

  // User tier
  if (user.tier === 'premium') return true;

  return false;
};
```
