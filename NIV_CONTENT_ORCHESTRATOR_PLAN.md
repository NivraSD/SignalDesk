# NIV Content Orchestrator - Intelligent Edge Function Plan

## Executive Summary
Create a sophisticated edge function (`niv-content-orchestrator`) that intelligently orchestrates content generation, similar to how `niv-orchestrator-robust` handles strategic planning. This would move orchestration logic from the frontend to the backend, enabling much smarter content creation.

---

## üéØ Core Capabilities

### 1. **Intent Recognition**
Unlike the current simple routing, the orchestrator would:
- Analyze user input to understand true intent
- Identify content needs even when not explicitly stated
- Detect multiple content requirements in a single request
- Understand context clues (urgency, audience, purpose)

### 2. **Context Aggregation**
Automatically pull in relevant context from:
- **Memory Vault** - Previous strategies and content
- **Intelligence Pipeline** - Current market insights
- **Opportunity Engine** - Active opportunities
- **Content Library** - Similar past content for consistency
- **Organization Profile** - Brand voice, guidelines, preferences

### 3. **Multi-Step Orchestration**
Execute complex content workflows:
```
User: "We need to respond to the competitor announcement"
    ‚Üì
Orchestrator:
1. Searches intelligence for competitor details
2. Analyzes our positioning vs competitor
3. Generates press release
4. Creates social posts
5. Drafts internal memo
6. Prepares executive talking points
```

### 4. **Intelligent Routing**
Dynamically decide which services to call:
- **mcp-content** - For standard content generation
- **mcp-visual** - For images/videos
- **gamma-presentation** - For slide decks
- **niv-orchestrator-robust** - For strategic context
- **firecrawl/search** - For real-time information

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Edge Function: `niv-content-orchestrator`

```typescript
// Main orchestrator function
async function orchestrateContent(request: {
  prompt: string,
  conversation: Message[],
  contentType?: string,
  organization: Organization,
  framework?: Framework,
  opportunity?: Opportunity
}) {

  // Step 1: Analyze Intent
  const intent = await analyzeIntent(prompt, conversation)

  // Step 2: Gather Context
  const context = await gatherContext({
    intent,
    organization,
    framework,
    opportunity
  })

  // Step 3: Plan Content Strategy
  const contentPlan = await planContentStrategy({
    intent,
    context,
    requirements: extractRequirements(prompt)
  })

  // Step 4: Execute Content Generation
  const results = await executeContentPlan(contentPlan)

  // Step 5: Quality Assurance
  const finalContent = await qualityAssurance(results, context)

  return finalContent
}
```

## üîÑ Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Crisis Response
**User Input**: "Negative article just published about us on TechCrunch"
