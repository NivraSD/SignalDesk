## Deprecation Process

### When to Remove Research

```
REMOVE if:
- Methodology debunked
- Findings not reproducible
- Author retracted
- Superseded by better research
- >15 years old and no longer cited

MARK AS HISTORICAL if:
- Still foundational but dated
- Context has changed (pre-social media)
- Better alternatives exist
- Worth knowing but not applying
```

### Deprecation Template

```typescript
// Don't delete - mark as historical
{
  title: 'Original Study Name',
  author: 'Original Author',
  type: 'academic_paper',
  status: 'HISTORICAL',  // Add this field
  historical_note: 'Foundational work, but see [New Study] for updated findings',
  superseded_by: {
    title: 'New Study Name',
    url: 'https://...',
    year: '2026'
  },
  original_priority: 'critical',
  current_priority: 'medium',
  keep_reason: 'Historical context for field development'
}
```
