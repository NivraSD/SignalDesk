# Prediction System - Full Implementation Complete! üéâ

## What Was Built

We've implemented a **complete prediction tracking and validation system** with:

### ‚úÖ 1. Target Integration
- Predictions automatically linked to intelligence targets
- Shows target badges (üè¢ Competitor, üìå Topic, üîë Keyword, üë§ Influencer)
- Filters predictions by target type
- Tracks accuracy per target

### ‚úÖ 2. Event Tracking
- Records which intelligence event triggered each prediction
- Shows trigger event summary in UI
- Links predictions back to source intelligence

### ‚úÖ 3. Automated Monitoring
- Background service checks predictions for outcomes
- Searches intelligence for validation evidence
- Updates monitoring status: watching ‚Üí signals_detected ‚Üí outcome_imminent
- Auto-validates predictions when outcome detected
- Auto-expires predictions when deadline passes

### ‚úÖ 4. Manual Validation
- "Came True" / "Didn't Happen" buttons on each prediction
- Record actual outcomes
- Build validation dataset

### ‚úÖ 5. Accuracy Tracking
- Overall accuracy percentage
- Accuracy by target
- Accuracy by timeframe (1-week, 1-month, 3-months, etc.)
- Confidence calibration metrics

### ‚úÖ 6. Monitoring Dashboard
- Real-time monitoring status
- Target accuracy tables
- Manual monitor trigger
- Today's validations/expirations

## How To Use

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration

Run in Supabase SQL Editor:
```sql
-- Copy and paste contents of:
-- supabase/migrations/20251027_prediction_tracking_system.sql
```

This creates:
- `prediction_outcomes` table
- `prediction_monitoring` table
- `target_prediction_metrics` table
- `prediction_patterns` table
- Views: `predictions_with_monitoring`, `target_accuracy_summary`
- Automatic metric updates via triggers

### Step 2: Deploy Edge Functions

```bash
# Deploy the monitoring service
npx supabase functions deploy prediction-monitor

# Update the prediction generator (already exists, just redeploy)
npx supabase functions deploy real-time-prediction-generator
```

### Step 3: Set Up Cron Job (Optional - for automated monitoring)

In Supabase Dashboard:
1. Go to Database ‚Üí Cron Jobs
2. Create new job:
   - Schedule: `0 8 * * *` (daily at 8am)
   - Function: `prediction-monitor`
   - Enabled: ‚úì

### Step 4: Start Using!

**Generate Predictions:**
```typescript
// When calling real-time-prediction-generator:
await supabase.functions.invoke('real-time-prediction-generator', {
  body: {
    organization_id: orgId,
    organization_name: orgName,
    articles: articles,
    // NEW: Track what triggered this
    trigger_event_id: latestArticle.id,
    trigger_event_summary: latestArticle.title
  }
})
```

**View Predictions:**
- Open Stakeholder Prediction Dashboard
- See target badges: üè¢ Microsoft (Competitor)
- See trigger events: "Triggered by: Microsoft announces layoffs"
- Click "Came True" or "Didn't Happen" to validate

**Monitor Predictions:**
- Open Prediction Monitoring Dashboard (add to your UI)
- See active monitoring status
- View target accuracy table
- Click "Run Monitor Now" for manual check

## Example User Flow

### Scenario: Competitor Intelligence

**Day 0:**
```
1. Intelligence arrives: "Microsoft announces 10,000 layoffs"
2. Saved to content_library with id: article-123

3. Trigger prediction generation:
   - trigger_event_id: article-123
   - trigger_event_summary: "Microsoft announces 10,000 layoffs"

4. System generates:
   ‚úì Matched to target: "Microsoft" (competitor)
   ‚úì Prediction: "Microsoft will restructure cloud division in 3 months"
   ‚úì Confidence: 75%
   ‚úì Status: active
   ‚úì Monitoring: watching

5. User sees:
   üîÆ "Microsoft will restructure cloud division in 3 months"
   üè¢ Competitor
   Triggered by: "Microsoft announces 10,000 layoffs"
   Confidence: 75%
```

**Day 30:**
```
Automated monitor runs:
1. Searches recent intelligence
2. Finds: "Microsoft posts VP-level cloud positions"
3. Supporting signal detected!
4. Status: watching ‚Üí signals_detected
5. Confidence trend: stable ‚Üí increasing
```

**Day 75:**
```
Automated monitor runs:
1. Finds: "Microsoft announces new cloud org structure"
2. AI analysis: 90% match to prediction!
3. Auto-validates prediction ‚úÖ
4. Status: active ‚Üí validated
5. Records outcome:
   - Occurred: true
   - Accuracy: 90%
   - Timing accuracy: 95% (75 days vs 90 predicted)

6. Updates metrics:
   - Microsoft accuracy: 83% (5/6 predictions)
   - Overall accuracy: 78% (14/18)
```

**Result:**
You had **75-day advance warning** of Microsoft's restructuring! üéØ

- Check frequency: Increased (more frequent checks)

### Outcome Imminent (‚ö°)
- Multiple strong signals
- Deadline approaching
- Check frequency: Daily

### Validated (‚úÖ)
- Outcome confirmed (came true)
- Accuracy recorded
- Metrics updated

### Invalidated (‚ùå)
- Manually marked as didn't happen
- Accuracy: 0%
- Metrics updated

## Accuracy Metrics Explained

### Overall Accuracy
```
Successful Predictions / Total Validated Predictions √ó 100
```

### Timing Accuracy
```
How close was the timing?

- ¬±20% of window: 80-99%
- Beyond window: <80%
```

### Confidence Calibration
```
Tracks:
- Avg confidence when prediction was right
- Avg confidence when prediction was wrong

Goal: Confidence should match reality
- 80% confidence ‚Üí 80% accuracy
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Add Targets First
Before generating predictions, add your key targets:
```typescript
await createTarget({
  name: "Microsoft",
  type: "competitor",
  priority: "high",
  keywords: ["Azure", "cloud", "AI"]
})
```

### 2. Always Pass Trigger Events
When generating predictions, always include trigger:
```typescript
trigger_event_id: article.id,
trigger_event_summary: article.title
```

### 3. Validate Regularly
- Validate predictions as outcomes occur
- Don't wait for automated validation
- Use "Didn't Happen" for failed predictions (helps learning!)

### 4. Review Accuracy Weekly
- Check target accuracy table
- Identify best/worst performers
- Adjust targets and keywords

### 5. Run Monitor Daily
Set up cron job for daily checks, or run manually:
```typescript
await supabase.functions.invoke('prediction-monitor')
```

## Troubleshooting

### Predictions not showing target badges?
- Check if targets exist for organization
- Verify target names/keywords match prediction stakeholders
- Re-run prediction generator

### Monitoring not working?
- Check if prediction-monitor is deployed
- Verify cron job is enabled
- Check Supabase logs for errors
- Run manually to test

### Accuracy metrics not updating?
- Trigger should fire automatically
- Check prediction_outcomes table has records
- Manually refresh: `SELECT update_target_metrics_on_validation()`

### No validations happening?
- Check if intelligence is being ingested
- Verify AI key is set (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
- Run monitor manually to test

## Quick Reference

**Generate Prediction:**
```typescript
await supabase.functions.invoke('real-time-prediction-generator', {
  body: { organization_id, articles, trigger_event_id }
})
```

**Validate Manually:**
```typescript
// Click "Came True" or "Didn't Happen" button in UI
// Or programmatically:
await supabase.from('predictions').update({ status: 'validated' }).eq('id', id)
await supabase.from('prediction_outcomes').insert({ prediction_id: id, outcome_occurred: true })
```

**Run Monitor:**
```typescript
await supabase.functions.invoke('prediction-monitor')
```

**Check Accuracy:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM target_accuracy_summary
WHERE organization_id = 'your-org'
ORDER BY accuracy_percentage DESC
```
