## Integration with Existing System

### How It Works with NIVPanel

**NIVPanel** (existing chat interface):
- Full conversational AI for strategic planning
- Deep campaign blueprint generation
- Opened via dropdown menu
- Handles complex multi-step workflows

**Command Center** (new dashboard):
- High-level intelligence overview
- Real-time activity monitoring
- Smart action recommendations
- **Links to** NIVPanel for deep thinking

**Relationship:**
Command Center is the **"What do I need to know/do?"**
NIVPanel is the **"Help me think through this strategically"**

### Canvas Integration

Added to InfiniteCanvas:
```typescript
// COMPONENT_TYPES array (line 58)
{
  id: 'command-center',
  label: 'Command Center',
  icon: Home,
  color: 'from-purple-600 to-pink-600',
  defaultWidth: 1200,
  defaultHeight: 800
}

// renderComponentContent (line 357)
case 'command-center':
  return (
    <CommandCenterV2
      onNavigateToTab={(tabId, context) => {
        addComponent(tabId) // Opens requested module
      }}
    />
  )
```

Users can now:
1. Click "Command Center" in the module selector
2. See the dashboard with real-time intelligence
3. Click "Open NIV Assistant" to access full chat
4. Click suggested actions to open relevant modules

## Database Queries

The Command Center queries these tables:

```sql
-- Opportunities (urgent, high-scoring, expiring)
SELECT * FROM opportunities
WHERE organization_id = ?
  AND score >= 80
ORDER BY score DESC;

-- Active Campaigns
SELECT * FROM campaign_builder_sessions
WHERE organization_id = ?
  AND status IN ('in_progress', 'active')
ORDER BY updated_at DESC;

-- Recent Content
SELECT * FROM content_library
WHERE organization_id = ?
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 15;
```

**Performance:** All queries use indexed fields (organization_id, score, status, created_at).

## Technical Notes

### State Management
- Uses React hooks (useState, useEffect)
- Supabase client for data fetching
- Auto-refresh via setInterval (30s)

### Performance
- Loads only top 15 activities (prevents bloat)
- Limits opportunities queries (top 3 urgent, top 5 for suggestions)
- Indexed database queries for speed

### Styling
- Tailwind CSS with dark mode theme
- Gradient accents (purple/pink brand colors)
- Responsive grid layout (2 columns on large screens)
- Smooth transitions and hover states

### Error Handling
- Try/catch on all database queries
- Console logging for debugging
- Graceful fallbacks (shows placeholder if no data)
- Loading states with skeleton screens

## Conclusion

**Phase 1 (Command Center) Status:** Core implementation complete and ready for testing.

**What Works:** Users can now see all critical intelligence at a glance, get smart action recommendations, and quickly navigate to relevant workflows.

**What's Next:** Test the data loading, wire it up as the default home tab, then move on to Phase 2 (Memory Vault V2).

**Estimated Time to Full Production:** 2-3 days of testing and polish, then ready for users.
