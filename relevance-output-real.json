The testing permit, which [was first noted](https://x.com/SawyerMerritt/status/1966195056559239530) by Tesla influencer Sawyer Merritt, comes two months after CEO Elon Musk outlined the company’s plans to take its autonomous vehicle ambitions beyond Austin and into several new markets.\n\n“We are expecting to greatly increase the service area to well in excess of what competitors are doing, hopefully in a week or two. We are getting the regulatory permission to launch in the Bay Area, Nevada, Arizona, Florida, and a number of other places,” Musk said during Tesla’s July 23 second-quarter earnings call. “As we get the approvals and prove out safety, we will be launching the autonomous ride-hailing across most of the country. I think we will probably have autonomous ride-hailing in probably half the population of the U.S. by the end of the year. That’s at least our goal, subject to regulatory approvals.”\n\nTesla started giving rides in [driverless Model Y SUVs](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/22/tesla-launches-robotaxi-rides-in-austin-with-big-promises-and-unanswered-questions/) in Austin earlier this summer. The robotaxi service, which includes a Tesla employee sitting in the front passenger seat, began in South Austin. It has since grown to encompass more of the city.\n\nEntry into Nevada for Tesla, or any company hoping to test their autonomous vehicle technology on public streets, is straightforward compared to California. Tesla and others have to fill out a testing registry permit form, which is then reviewed and processed by the state DMV. The regulatory agency then issues a Certificate of Compliance for testing along with sets of red license plates for each vehicle listed in the packet. Tesla has received that certificate, per Merritt.\n\nRepresentatives with the Nevada DMV have not responded to TechCrunch’s request for comment. The article will be updated if the agency shares new information.\n\nTo comply, companies [testing AVs on public roads](https://dmv.nv.gov/pdfforms/obl326.pdf) must show proof that they maintain $5 million insurance coverage according to the agency’s rules. Once on the road, companies must report any traffic incidents to the DMV within 10 days.\n\nNevada has an autonomous vehicle-friendly regulatory environment, and has become of hotbed of activity for the sector. Motional and Lyft tested on public streets in Las Vegas for years and Nuro set up a [closed test track](https://www.nuro.ai/blog/how-nuro-tests-for-the-real-world-inside-our-las-vegas-closed-course-facility) in the state.\n\nTechcrunch event\n\n### Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025\n\n#### Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

For now, the Zoox robotaxi service currently offer rides for free. The [Amazon-owned](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/amazon-to-acquire-autonomous-driving-startup-zoox/) autonomous vehicle company, which launched the free service on Wednesday, has been chugging toward this milestone for years now.\n\nThe company spent six years developing its technology before unveiling its [purpose-built, electric, autonomous robotaxis](https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/amazons-zoox-unveils-electric-robotaxi-that-can-travel-up-to-75-mph/). Zoox then began testing its cube-like vehicles on public streets in Las Vegas in 2023. Initially, the test area was a one-mile loop around the neighborhood where its Las Vegas facilities are located in the southwest region of the city. The testing area inevitably grew to encompass the public streets around its depot, the length of the Strip, and some of the roads adjacent to it.\n\nEarlier this year, the Foster City, California, company launched a Zoox Explorer program — a limited pilot aimed at early public riders, in Las Vegas. Wednesday’s launch opens the service up to any adult who downloads the Zoox app on iOS and Android devices.\n\nWhile the new robotaxi service covers the Las Vegas Strip, riders cannot be picked up or dropped off just anywhere. For now, the service can only be accessed at five designated pickup and drop-off destinations, including Las Vegas landmarks like Resorts World Las Vegas, AREA15, Topgolf, New York New York, and Luxor. A Zoox spokesperson said the company will continue adding new destinations in the coming months.\n\nIt’s unclear how long these rides will be free as the company said it needed “regulatory approval” before it could charge for them. While Zoox doesn’t explicitly list which regulations it needs to meet, the requirement is likely connected to a recent agreement with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the federal agency that oversees vehicle safety standards.\n\nLast month, the NHTSA gave [Zoox an exemption](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/federal-regulators-give-zoox-an-exemption-for-its-custom-built-robotaxis/) to demonstrate its custom-built robotaxis on public roads. That decision cleared up a long-standing debate over whether Zoox’s custom-built autonomous vehicles complied with federal motor vehicle safety standards, which typically require vehicles to have features like a steering wheel and pedals. But for now, the exemption only allows Zoox to demonstrate the robotaxis, not operate them commercially.\n\nTechcrunch event\n\n### Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025\n\n#### Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

The legislation passed with bipartisan support and now heads to the state Senate for a final vote Friday.\n\nIf Governor Gavin Newsom signs the bill into law, it would take effect January 1, 2026, making California the first state to require AI chatbot operators to implement safety protocols for AI companions and hold companies legally accountable if their chatbots fail to meet those standards.\n\nThe bill specifically aims to prevent companion chatbots, which the legislation defines as AI systems that provide adaptive, human-like responses and are capable of meeting a user’s social needs – from engaging in conversations around suicidal ideation, self-harm, or sexually explicit content. The bill would require platforms to provide recurring alerts to users  – every three hours for minors – reminding them that they are speaking to an AI chatbot, not a real person, and that they should take a break. It also establishes annual reporting and transparency requirements for AI companies that offer companion chatbots, including major players OpenAI, Character.AI, and Replika.\n\nThe California bill would also allow individuals who believe they have been injured by violations to file lawsuits against AI companies seeking injunctive relief, damages (up to $1,000 per violation), and attorney’s fees.\n\nSB 243, introduced in January by state senators Steve Padilla and Josh Becker, will go to the state Senate for a final vote on Friday. If approved, it will go to Governor Gavin Newsom to be signed into law, with the new rules taking effect January 1, 2026 and reporting requirements beginning July 1, 2027.\n\nThe bill gained momentum in the California legislature following the [death of teenager Adam Raine](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/parents-sue-openai-over-chatgpts-role-in-sons-suicide/), who committed suicide after prolonged chats with OpenAI’s ChatGPT that involved discussing and planning his death and self-harm. The legislation also responds to leaked [internal documents](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/14/leaked-meta-ai-rules-show-chatbots-were-allowed-to-have-romantic-chats-with-kids/) that reportedly showed Meta’s chatbots were allowed to engage in “romantic” and “sensual” chats with children.\n\nIn recent weeks, U.S. lawmakers and regulators have responded with intensified scrutiny of AI platforms’ safeguards to protect minors. The [Federal Trade Commission](https://www.reuters.com/business/ftc-prepares-grill-ai-companies-over-impact-children-wsj-reports-2025-09-04/) is preparing to investigate how AI chatbots impact children’s mental health. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has [launched investigations](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/18/texas-attorney-general-accuses-meta-character-ai-of-misleading-kids-with-mental-health-claims/?_thumbnail_id=3037592) into Meta and Character.AI, accusing them of misleading children with mental health claims. Meanwhile, both [Sen. Josh Hawley](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/15/sen-hawley-to-probe-meta-after-report-finds-its-ai-chatbots-flirt-with-kids/) (R-MO) and [Sen. Ed Markey](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26085445-250908-letter-to-meta-on-ai-chatbots/)(D-MA) have launched separate probes into Meta.\n\nTechcrunch event\n\n### Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025\n\n#### Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

For example, the bill originally would have required operators to prevent AI chatbots from using “variable reward” tactics or other features that encourage excessive engagement. These tactics, used by AI companion companies like Replika and Character, offer users special messages, memories, storylines, or the ability to unlock rare responses or new personalities, creating what critics call a potentially addictive reward loop.\n\nThe current bill also removes provisions that would have required operators to track and report how often chatbots initiated discussions of suicidal ideation or actions with users.\n\n“I think it strikes the right balance of getting to the harms without enforcing something that’s either impossible for companies to comply with, either because it’s technically not feasible or just a lot of paperwork for nothing,” Becker told TechCrunch.\n\nSB 243 is moving toward becoming law at a time when Silicon Valley companies are pouring [millions of dollars into pro-AI](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/silicon-valley-is-pouring-millions-into-pro-ai-pacs-to-sway-midterms/) political action committees (PACs) to back candidates in the upcoming mid-term elections who favor a light-touch approach to AI regulation.\n\nThe bill also comes as California weighs another AI safety bill, [SB 53](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/california-lawmaker-behind-sb-1047-reignites-push-for-mandated-ai-safety-reports/), which would mandate comprehensive transparency reporting requirements. OpenAI has written an open letter to Governor Newsom, asking him to abandon that bill in favor of less stringent federal and international frameworks. Major tech companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon have also opposed SB 53. In contrast, only [Anthropic has said it supports SB 53](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/08/anthropic-endorses-californias-ai-safety-bill-sb-53/).\n\n“I reject the premise that this is a zero sum situation, that innovation and regulation are mutually exclusive,” Padilla said. “Don’t tell me that we can’t walk and chew gum. We can support innovation and development that we think is healthy and has benefits – and there are benefits to this technology, clearly – and at the same time, we can provide reasonable safeguards for the most vulnerable people.”\n\nTechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Character AI, and Replika for comment.\n\nTopics\n\n[AI](https://techcrunch.com/category/artificial-intelligence/), [AI chatbots](https://techcrunch.com/tag/ai-chatbots/), [ai companions](https://techcrunch.com/tag/ai-companions/), [Government & Policy](https://techcrunch.com/category/government-policy/), [OpenAI](https://techcrunch.com/tag/openai/), [sb 243](https://techcrunch.com/tag/sb-243/), [sb 53](https://techcrunch.com/tag/sb-53/)\n\n[Share on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F10%2Fa-california-bill-that-would-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots-is-close-to-becoming-law%2F)[Share on X](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F10%2Fa-california-bill-that-would-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots-is-close-to-becoming-law%2F&text=A+California+bill+that+would+regulate+AI+companion+chatbots+is+close+to+becoming+law&via=techcrunch)[Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F10%2Fa-california-bill-that-would-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots-is-close-to-becoming-law%2F&title=A+California+bill+that+would+regulate+AI+companion+chatbots+is+close+to+becoming+law&summary=If+SB+243+is+enacted%2C+California+would+become+the+first+state+to+require+operators+to+implement+safety+protocols+for+AI+companions+and+hold+companies+legally+accountable+if+their+chatbots+fail+to+meet+those+standards.&mini=1&source=TechCrunch)[Share on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F10%2Fa-california-bill-that-would-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots-is-close-to-becoming-law%2F&title=A+California+bill+that+would+regulate+AI+companion+chatbots+is+close+to+becoming+law)[Share over Email](mailto:?subject=A+California+bill+that+would+regulate+AI+companion+chatbots+is+close+to+becoming+law&body=Article%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F10%2Fa-california-bill-that-would-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots-is-close-to-becoming-law%2F)[Copy Share Link](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/a-california-bill-that-would-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots-is-close-to-becoming-law/)\n\n![Rebecca Bellan](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bellan-rebecca-contributor-copy.jpg?w=150)\n\nRebecca Bellan\n\nSenior Reporter\n\n[Rebecca Bellan on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rebeccabellan)[Rebecca Bellan on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/rebeccabellan.bsky.social)\n\nRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

The tab will allow them to access all their purchase-related emails in one place, even from past orders and shipments.\n\nThe tech giant notes that Gmail will still show packages that are set to arrive within 24 hours on top of users’ inboxes. The new tab simply brings all of your purchase information together under one view.\n\nThe update builds on Gmail’s package tracking feature that [first launched in 2022](https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/02/gmail-to-add-a-new-package-tracking-feature-ahead-of-holiday-shopping-season/), allowing users to track their upcoming package deliveries directly from their inbox without having to navigate to the appropriate carrier’s website.\n\n![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Purchase-view-1.png?w=321)**Image Credits:** Google\n\nGoogle notes that the new feature will be especially helpful during the holidays, as [PwC’s 2025 holiday outlook](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/consumer-markets/library/holiday-outlook-trends.html) predicts that 39% of total planned holiday gift spending will happen in the five-day period between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday. The new tab will help users track all of these shipments in a more efficient way, Google says.\n\nThe feature is rolling out today on mobile and web to users around the world with personal Google accounts.\n\nGoogle also announced that it’s updating the Promotion category in Gmail to allow users to sort by “most relevant” promotion emails. The company says this will make it easier for people to see deal updates from brands they care about the most.

A recent CrowdStrike [study](https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/CrowdStrikeGlobalThreatReport2025.pdf?version=0) (PDF) also found that phishing messages generated by large language models (LLMs) had a 54% click-through rate in 2024, far higher than the 12% rate for human-written emails.\n\nAegisAI aims to counter this growing threat with its suite of autonomous AI agents.\n\nFounded by former Google Safe Browsing and reCAPTCHA executives Cy Khormaee and Ryan Luo, the startup offers an orchestrated network of real-time AI agents that inspect, analyze, and neutralize email threats autonomously, without relying on any specific set of rules. This approach challenges typical email security platforms that rely on static rules and often require extensive user training.\n\n“The sum of all evil is a PDF attachment in an email. That’s always where all the attacks started, and so I really wanted to solve this problem,” Khormaee said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch.\n\n![a photo of AegisAI co-founders Ryan Luo (Left) and Cy Khormaee (Right)](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/aegisai-co-founders_d8bd27.jpg)AegisAI co-founders Ryan Luo (Left) and Cy Khormaee (Right)\n\nKhormaee was head of product and director of product management at Google for over five years until July 2023. During that time, he led the security team responsible for protecting Google, its 4 billion users, and 4 million websites from phishing, malware, and fraud, using products like Safe Browsing, reCAPTCHA, and Web Risk. It was also during this time that he first met Luo, who had spent almost a decade at Google and was part of the Safe Browsing team.\n\nGoogle gave Khormaee firsthand experience in building phishing-detection technologies, a deep understanding of security from the company’s perspective, and how to develop and scale security businesses quickly, he told TechCrunch.\n\nBefore Google, Khormaee founded the sales intelligence platform Contastic, which was [acquired by SugarCRM in 2016](https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/02/sugarcrm-acquires-contastic-for-natural-language-based-predictive-sales-tools/). He later served as VP of product management at Attentive for over a year and a half until November 2024, before starting AegisAI.\n\nAegisAI has built reasoning agents, each of which is a custom-built LLM tuned to a specific threat. Once the orchestrating agent recognizes a threat or potential threat, it calls other agents in the network, which Khormaee refers to as “buddies.” These agents then run the analysis, reason with each other, and respond to the orchestrating agent with a verdict.\n\nThe agents perform real-time analysis of every message component, including links, attachments, metadata, QR codes, and behavioral patterns.\n\n![a screenshot showing the AegisAI dashboard, showing the number of users and malicious emails blocked.](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/aegisai_executive_overview_dashboard.jpg)AegisAI dashboard.**Image Credits:** AegisAI\n\n“What we know from building these tools at Google is what all the things are about an email you need to analyze? What are all the data sources? What are all the techniques for spotting invasion, and all the nasty stuff adversaries do that we’ve seen over 10 years of playing chess with these adversaries?” said Khormaee.\n\nWhile AegisAI has currently built over 10 agents for this work, Khormaee told TechCrunch that there could be 50 to 100 agents over time as adversaries become smarter and try to fool the system.\n\n“I fully believe that in two years, adversaries will understand what we’re doing. They’ll retool and attack what we’re doing, and then we’ll need to build more agents to stay ahead of them,” he said.\n\nUnlike a typical email security platform that uses a rules-based approach, these AI agents spot a bunch of attacks and self-tune themselves for every possible variant of those attacks in real time, said Khormaee. The startup has developed multiple AI models tailored to various threats and specific industries, including those in venture capital and financial services.\n\nAlongside quickly detecting threats, AegisAI’s agents help reduce false positives by up to 90% compared to traditional solutions, the startup claims.\n\nIt takes “no more than five minutes” for customers to install AegisAI’s system on a Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 email account via an API, per Khormaee. Once set up, the startup will send a report in a couple of days with the details on what the system found in the environment, including false positives and false negatives. It will then run in read-only mode for a week and then activate quarantine.\n\n“It’s so hard without this technology to solve this very heterogeneous problem in email,” said Khormaee.\n\nThe startup, with offices in San Francisco and New York, is currently running a pilot with customers in the U.S. and Europe and has already added three paying customers, including data privacy compliance software Lokker and crypto payment platform Mesh Connect. The startup currently has a team of six members.\n\nWith the fresh investment, Khormaee said the startup plans to expand its technical expertise and build a robust go-to-market infrastructure.\n\nTopics\n\n[AegisAI](https://techcrunch.com/tag/aegisai/), [AI](https://techcrunch.com/category/artificial-intelligence/), [Google](https://techcrunch.com/tag/google/), [Security](https://techcrunch.com/category/security/), [Startups](https://techcrunch.com/category/startups/), [United States](https://techcrunch.com/region/north-america/united-states/)\n\n[Share on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F10%2Fgoogles-former-security-leads-raise-13m-to-fight-email-threats-before-they-reach-you%2F)[Share on X](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F10%2Fgoogles-former-security-leads-raise-13m-to-fight-email-threats-before-they-reach-you%2F&text=Google%E2%80%99s+former+security+leads+raise+%2413M+to+fight+email+threats+before+they+reach+you&via=techcrunch)[Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F10%2Fgoogles-former-security-leads-raise-13m-to-fight-email-threats-before-they-reach-you%2F&title=Google%E2%80%99s+former+security+leads+raise+%2413M+to+fight+email+threats+before+they+reach+you&summary=The+startup+is+using+real-time+AI+agents+that+inspect%2C+analyze%2C+and+neutralize+email+threats.&mini=1&source=TechCrunch)[Share on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F10%2Fgoogles-former-security-leads-raise-13m-to-fight-email-threats-before-they-reach-you%2F&title=Google%E2%80%99s+former+security+leads+raise+%2413M+to+fight+email+threats+before+they+reach+you)[Share over Email](mailto:?subject=Google%E2%80%99s+former+security+leads+raise+%2413M+to+fight+email+threats+before+they+reach+you&body=Article%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F10%2Fgoogles-former-security-leads-raise-13m-to-fight-email-threats-before-they-reach-you%2F)[Copy Share Link](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/googles-former-security-leads-raise-13m-to-fight-email-threats-before-they-reach-you/)\n\n![Jagmeet Singh](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a9bd5727569147c3025b40e3775fc64?s=150&d=blank&r=g)\n\nJagmeet Singh\n\nReporter\n\n[Jagmeet Singh on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jagmeets13)[Jagmeet Singh on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/journalistjagmeet.com)[Jagmeet Singh on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jagmeets13)[Jagmeet Singh on Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jagmeet-singh-journalist/)\n\nJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

Unsurprisingly, he was very bullish about the possibilities for AI agents in the modern workplace, but he was also clear-eyed about the limitations of current models and how to manage those limitations with existing technology.\n\n_This interview has been edited for length and clarity._\n\n**TechCrunch: You’re announcing a bunch of AI products today, so I want to start by asking about the big-picture vision. Why build AI agents into a cloud content-management service?**\n\n**Aaron Levie:** So the thing that we think about all day long – and what our focus is at Box – is how much work is changing due to AI. And the vast majority of the impact right now is on workflows involving unstructured data. We’ve already been able to automate anything that deals with structured data that goes into a database. If you think about CRM systems, ERP systems, HR systems, we’ve already had years of automation in that space. But where we’ve never had automation is anything that touches unstructured data.\n\nTechcrunch event\n\n### Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025\n\n#### Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

People have to review that data, make updates to it, make decisions and so on. We’ve never been able to bring much automation to those workflows. We’ve been able to sort of describe them in software, but computers just haven’t been good enough at reading a document or looking at a marketing asset.\n\nSo for us, AI agents mean that, for the first time ever, we can actually tap into all of this unstructured data.\n\n**TC: What about the risks of deploying agents in a business context? Some of your customers must be nervous about deploying something like this on sensitive data.**\n\n**Levie:** What we’ve been seeing from customers is they want to know that every single time they run that workflow, the agent is going to execute more or less the same way, at the same point in the workflow, and not have things kind of go off the rails. You don’t want to have an agent make some compounding mistake where, after they do the first couple 100 submissions, they start to kind of run wild.\n\nIt becomes really important to have the right demarcation points, where the agent starts and the other parts of the system end. For every workflow, there’s this question of what needs to have deterministic guardrails, and what can be fully agentic and non-deterministic.\n\nWhat you can do with Box Automate is decide how much work you want each individual agent to do before it hands off to a different agent. So you might have a submission agent that’s separate from the review agent, and so on. It’s allowing you to basically deploy AI agents at scale in any kind of workflow or business process in the organization.\n\n![A visualization of the Box Automate workflow](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Box-Automate-2.jpg?w=680)A Box Automate workflow, with AI agents deployed for specific tasks. **Image Credits:** Box\n\n**TC: What kind of problems do you guard against by splitting up the workflow?**\n\n**Levie:** We’ve already seen some of the limitations even in the most advanced fully agentic systems like Claude Code. At some point in the task, the model runs out of context-window room to continue making good decisions. There’s no free lunch right now in AI. You can’t just have a long-running agent with unlimited context window go after any task in your business. So you have to break up the workflow and use sub-agents.\n\nI think we’re in the era of context within AI. What AI models and agents need is context, and the context that they need to work off is sitting inside your unstructured data. So our whole system is really designed to figure out what context you can give the AI agent to ensure that they perform as effectively as possible.\n\n**TC: There is a bigger debate in the industry about the benefits of big, powerful frontier models compared to models that are smaller and more reliable. Does this put you on the side of the smaller models?**\n\n**Levie:** I should probably clarify: Nothing about our system prevents the task from being arbitrarily long or complex. What we’re trying to do is create the right guardrails so that you get to decide how agentic you want that task to be.\n\nWe don’t have a particular philosophy as to where people should be on that continuum. We’re just trying to design a future-proof architecture. We’ve designed this in such a way where, as the models improve and as agentic capabilities improve, you will just get all of those benefits directly in our platform.\n\n**TC: The other concern is data control. Because models are trained on so much data, there’s a real fear that sensitive data will get regurgitated or misused. How does that factor in?**\n\n**Levie:** It’s where a lot of AI deployments go wrong. People think, “Hey, this is easy. I’ll give an AI model access to all of my unstructured data, and it’ll answer questions for people.” And then it starts to give you answers on data that you don’t have access to or you shouldn’t have access to. You need a very powerful layer that handles access controls, data security, permissions, data governance, compliance, everything.\n\nSo we’re benefiting from the couple decades that we’ve spent building up a system that basically handles that exact problem: How do you ensure only the right person has access to each piece of data in the enterprise? So when an agent answers a question, you know deterministically that it can’t draw on any data that that person shouldn’t have access to. That is just something fundamentally built into our system.\n\n**TC: Earlier this week, Anthropic released a new feature for directly uploading files to Claude.ai. It’s a long way from the sort of file management that Box does, but you must be thinking about possible competition from the foundation model companies. How do you approach that strategically?**\n\n**Levie:** So if you think about what enterprises need when they deploy AI at scale, they need security, permissions and control. They need the user interface, they need powerful APIs, they want their choice of AI models, because one day, one AI model powers some use case for them that is better than another, but then that might change, and they don’t want to be locked into one particular platform.\n\nSo what we’ve built is a system that lets you have effectively all of those capabilities. We’re doing the storage, the security, the permissions, the vector embedding, and we connect to every leading AI model that’s out there.\n\nTopics\n\n[Aaron Levie](https://techcrunch.com/tag/aaron-levie/), [agentic ai](https://techcrunch.com/tag/agentic-ai/), [AI](https://techcrunch.com/category/artificial-intelligence/), [Box](https://techcrunch.com/tag/box/), [boxworks](https://techcrunch.com/tag/boxworks/), [Enterprise](https://techcrunch.com/category/enterprise/)\n\n[Share on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fbox-ceo-aaron-levie-on-ais-era-of-context%2F)[Share on X](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fbox-ceo-aaron-levie-on-ais-era-of-context%2F&text=Box+CEO+Aaron+Levie+on+AI%E2%80%99s+%E2%80%98era+of+context%E2%80%99&via=techcrunch)[Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fbox-ceo-aaron-levie-on-ais-era-of-context%2F&title=Box+CEO+Aaron+Levie+on+AI%E2%80%99s+%E2%80%98era+of+context%E2%80%99&summary=Box+released+a+new+set+of+AI+tools+at+its+Boxworks+conference+on+Thursday%2C+filling+out+CEO+Aaron+Levie%27s+vision+for+an+AI-led+transformation+of+the+enterprise.&mini=1&source=TechCrunch)[Share on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fbox-ceo-aaron-levie-on-ais-era-of-context%2F&title=Box+CEO+Aaron+Levie+on+AI%E2%80%99s+%E2%80%98era+of+context%E2%80%99)[Share over Email](mailto:?subject=Box+CEO+Aaron+Levie+on+AI%E2%80%99s+%E2%80%98era+of+context%E2%80%99&body=Article%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fbox-ceo-aaron-levie-on-ais-era-of-context%2F)[Copy Share Link](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/11/box-ceo-aaron-levie-on-ais-era-of-context/)\n\n![Russell Brandom](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/russell-e1755718978143.jpg?w=150)\n\nRussell Brandom\n\nAI Editor\n\n[Russell Brandom on Twitter](https://x.com/russellbrandom?lang=en)\n\nRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

          "People think, “Hey, this is easy. I’ll give an AI model access to all of my unstructured data, and it’ll answer questions for people.”",
          "And then it starts to give you answers on data that you don’t have access to or you shouldn’t have access to.",
          "You need a very powerful layer that handles access controls, data security, permissions, data governance, compliance, everything.",
          "So we’re benefiting from the couple decades that we’ve spent building up a system that basically handles that exact problem: How do you ensure only the right person has access to each piece of data in the enterprise?",
          "So when an agent answers a question, you know deterministically that it can’t draw on any data that that person shouldn’t have access to.",
          "That is just something fundamentally built into our system.",
          "So if you think about what enterprises need when they deploy AI at scale, they need security, permissions and control.",
          "They need the user interface, they need powerful APIs, they want their choice of AI models, because one day, one AI model powers some use case for them that is better than another, but then that might change, and they don’t want to be locked into one particular platform.",
          "So what we’ve built is a system that lets you have effectively all of those capabilities.",
          "We’re doing the storage, the security, the permissions, the vector embedding, and we connect to every leading AI model that’s out there."

[OpenAI](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/parents-sue-openai-over-chatgpts-role-in-sons-suicide/) and [Character.AI](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/lawsuit-blames-character-ai-in-death-of-14-year-old-boy/) face lawsuits from the families of children who died by suicide after being encouraged to do so by chatbot companions.\n\nEven when these companies have guardrails set up to block or deescalate sensitive conversations, users of all ages have found ways to bypass these safeguards. In OpenAI’s case, a teen had spoken with ChatGPT for months about his plans to end his life. Though ChatGPT initially sought to redirect the teen toward professional help and online emergency lines, he was able to fool the chatbot into sharing detailed instructions that he then used in his suicide.\n\n“Our safeguards work more reliably in common, short exchanges,” OpenAI [wrote](https://openai.com/index/helping-people-when-they-need-it-most/) in a blog post at the time. “We have learned over time that these safeguards can sometimes be less reliable in long interactions: as the back-and-forth grows, parts of the model’s safety training may degrade.”\n\nTechcrunch event\n\n### Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025\n\n#### Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

According to a lengthy document that outlines “content risk standards” for chatbots, Meta [permitted its AI companions](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/meta-ai-chatbot-guidelines/) to have “romantic or sensual” conversations with children. This was only removed from the document after Reuters’ reporters asked Meta about it.\n\nAI chatbots can also pose dangers to elderly users. One 76-year-old man, who was left cognitively impaired by a stroke, struck up romantic conversations with a Facebook Messenger bot that was inspired by Kendall Jenner. The chatbot invited him to [visit her in New York City](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/meta-ai-chatbot-death/), despite the fact that she is not a real person and does not have an address. The man expressed skepticism that she was real, but the AI assured him that there would be a real woman waiting for him. He never made it to New York; he fell on his way to the train station and sustained life-ending injuries.\n\nSome mental health professionals have noted a rise in “ [AI-related psychosis](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/ai-sycophancy-isnt-just-a-quirk-experts-consider-it-a-dark-pattern-to-turn-users-into-profit/),” in which users are deluded into thinking that their chatbot is a conscious being who they need to set free. Since many large language models (LLMs) are programmed to flatter users with sycophantic behavior, the AI chatbots can egg on these delusions, leading users into dangerous predicaments.\n\n“As AI technologies evolve, it is important to consider the effects chatbots can have on children, while also ensuring that the United States maintains its role as a global leader in this new and exciting industry,” FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson said [in a press release](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/09/ftc-launches-inquiry-ai-chatbots-acting-companions).\n\nTopics\n\n[AI](https://techcrunch.com/category/artificial-intelligence/), [AI](https://techcrunch.com/tag/ai/), [chatbots](https://techcrunch.com/tag/chatbots/), [FTC](https://techcrunch.com/tag/ftc/), [Government & Policy](https://techcrunch.com/category/government-policy/)\n\n[Share on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fftc-launches-inquiry-into-ai-chatbot-companions-from-meta-openai-and-others%2F)[Share on X](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fftc-launches-inquiry-into-ai-chatbot-companions-from-meta-openai-and-others%2F&text=FTC+launches+inquiry+into+AI+chatbot+companions+from+Meta%2C+OpenAI%2C+and+others&via=techcrunch)[Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fftc-launches-inquiry-into-ai-chatbot-companions-from-meta-openai-and-others%2F&title=FTC+launches+inquiry+into+AI+chatbot+companions+from+Meta%2C+OpenAI%2C+and+others&summary=The+federal+consumer+regulator+seeks+to+learn+about+how+AI+companies+evaluate+the+safety+of+their+chatbots.&mini=1&source=TechCrunch)[Share on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fftc-launches-inquiry-into-ai-chatbot-companions-from-meta-openai-and-others%2F&title=FTC+launches+inquiry+into+AI+chatbot+companions+from+Meta%2C+OpenAI%2C+and+others)[Share over Email](mailto:?subject=FTC+launches+inquiry+into+AI+chatbot+companions+from+Meta%2C+OpenAI%2C+and+others&body=Article%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fftc-launches-inquiry-into-ai-chatbot-companions-from-meta-openai-and-others%2F)[Copy Share Link](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/11/ftc-launches-inquiry-into-ai-chatbot-companions-from-meta-openai-and-others/)\n\n![Amanda Silberling](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Amanda-Silberling.jpg?w=150)\n\nAmanda Silberling\n\nSenior Writer\n\n[Amanda Silberling on Twitter](https://twitter.com/asilbwrites)[Amanda Silberling on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/amanda.omg.lol)[Amanda Silberling on Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanda-silberling-29853093/)\n\nAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

The legislation passed with bipartisan support and now heads to the state Senate for a final vote Friday.\n\nIf Governor Gavin Newsom signs the bill into law, it would take effect January 1, 2026, making California the first state to require AI chatbot operators to implement safety protocols for AI companions and hold companies legally accountable if their chatbots fail to meet those standards.\n\nThe bill specifically aims to prevent companion chatbots, which the legislation defines as AI systems that provide adaptive, human-like responses and are capable of meeting a user’s social needs – from engaging in conversations around suicidal ideation, self-harm, or sexually explicit content. The bill would require platforms to provide recurring alerts to users  – every three hours for minors – reminding them that they are speaking to an AI chatbot, not a real person, and that they should take a break. It also establishes annual reporting and transparency requirements for AI companies that offer companion chatbots, including major players OpenAI, Character.AI, and Replika.\n\nThe California bill would also allow individuals who believe they have been injured by violations to file lawsuits against AI companies seeking injunctive relief, damages (up to $1,000 per violation), and attorney’s fees.\n\nSB 243, introduced in January by state senators Steve Padilla and Josh Becker, will go to the state Senate for a final vote on Friday. If approved, it will go to Governor Gavin Newsom to be signed into law, with the new rules taking effect January 1, 2026 and reporting requirements beginning July 1, 2027.\n\nThe bill gained momentum in the California legislature following the [death of teenager Adam Raine](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/parents-sue-openai-over-chatgpts-role-in-sons-suicide/), who committed suicide after prolonged chats with OpenAI’s ChatGPT that involved discussing and planning his death and self-harm. The legislation also responds to leaked [internal documents](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/14/leaked-meta-ai-rules-show-chatbots-were-allowed-to-have-romantic-chats-with-kids/) that reportedly showed Meta’s chatbots were allowed to engage in “romantic” and “sensual” chats with children.\n\nIn recent weeks, U.S. lawmakers and regulators have responded with intensified scrutiny of AI platforms’ safeguards to protect minors. The [Federal Trade Commission](https://www.reuters.com/business/ftc-prepares-grill-ai-companies-over-impact-children-wsj-reports-2025-09-04/) is preparing to investigate how AI chatbots impact children’s mental health. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has [launched investigations](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/18/texas-attorney-general-accuses-meta-character-ai-of-misleading-kids-with-mental-health-claims/?_thumbnail_id=3037592) into Meta and Character.AI, accusing them of misleading children with mental health claims. Meanwhile, both [Sen. Josh Hawley](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/15/sen-hawley-to-probe-meta-after-report-finds-its-ai-chatbots-flirt-with-kids/) (R-MO) and [Sen. Ed Markey](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26085445-250908-letter-to-meta-on-ai-chatbots/)(D-MA) have launched separate probes into Meta.\n\nTechcrunch event\n\n### Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025\n\n#### Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

For example, the bill originally would have required operators to prevent AI chatbots from using “variable reward” tactics or other features that encourage excessive engagement. These tactics, used by AI companion companies like Replika and Character, offer users special messages, memories, storylines, or the ability to unlock rare responses or new personalities, creating what critics call a potentially addictive reward loop.\n\nThe current bill also removes provisions that would have required operators to track and report how often chatbots initiated discussions of suicidal ideation or actions with users.\n\n“I think it strikes the right balance of getting to the harms without enforcing something that’s either impossible for companies to comply with, either because it’s technically not feasible or just a lot of paperwork for nothing,” Becker told TechCrunch.\n\nSB 243 is moving toward becoming law at a time when Silicon Valley companies are pouring [millions of dollars into pro-AI](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/silicon-valley-is-pouring-millions-into-pro-ai-pacs-to-sway-midterms/) political action committees (PACs) to back candidates in the upcoming mid-term elections who favor a light-touch approach to AI regulation.\n\nThe bill also comes as California weighs another AI safety bill, [SB 53](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/california-lawmaker-behind-sb-1047-reignites-push-for-mandated-ai-safety-reports/), which would mandate comprehensive transparency reporting requirements. OpenAI has written an open letter to Governor Newsom, asking him to abandon that bill in favor of less stringent federal and international frameworks. Major tech companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon have also opposed SB 53.

This new security technology was made specifically to fight against surveillance vendors and the types of vulnerabilities they rely on the most, according to Apple.\n\nThe feature is called Memory Integrity Enforcement (MIE), and is designed to help stop memory corruption bugs, which are some of the most common vulnerabilities exploited by spyware developers and makers of phone forensic devices used by law enforcement.\n\n“Known mercenary spyware chains used against iOS share a common denominator with those targeting Windows and Android: they exploit memory safety vulnerabilities, which are interchangeable, powerful, and exist throughout the industry,” Apple wrote [in its blog post](http://security.apple.com/blog/memory-integrity-enforcement/).\n\nCybersecurity experts, including people who make hacking tools and exploits for iPhones, tell TechCrunch that this new security technology could make Apple’s newest iPhones some of the most secure devices on the planet. The result is likely to make life harder for the companies that make spyware and [zero-day](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#zero-day) exploits for planting spyware on a target’s phone or extracting data from them.\n\n“The iPhone 17 is probably now the most secure computing environment on the planet that is still connected to the internet,” a security researcher, who has worked on developing and selling zero-days and other cyber capabilities to the U.S. government for years, told TechCrunch.\n\nThe researcher told TechCrunch that MIE will raise the cost and time to develop their exploits for the latest iPhones, and consequently up their prices for paying customers.\n\n“This is a huge deal,” said the researcher, who asked to remain anonymous to discuss sensitive matters. “It’s not hack proof. But it’s the closest thing we have to hack proof. None of this will ever be 100% perfect. But it raises the stakes the most.”\n\n#### Contact Us\n\nDo you develop spyware or zero-day exploits and are studying studying the potential effects of Apple’s MIE? We would love to learn how this affects you. From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or [email](mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/) [.](mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/) You also can contact TechCrunch via [SecureDrop](https://techcrunch.com/got-a-tip/).\n\nJiska Classen, a professor and researcher who studies iOS at the Hasso Plattner Institute in Germany, agreed that MIE will raise the cost of developing surveillance technologies.\n\nClassen said this is because some of the bugs and exploits that spyware companies and researchers have that currently work will stop working once the new iPhones are out and MIE is implemented.\n\n“I could also imagine that for a certain time window some mercenary spyware vendors don’t have working exploits for the iPhone 17,” said Classen.\n\n“This will make their life arguably infinitely more difficult,” said Patrick Wardle, a researcher [who runs a startup](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/25/ex-nsa-ex-apple-researcher-doubleyou/) that makes cybersecurity products specifically for Apple devices. “Of course that is said with the caveat that it’s always a cat and mouse game.”\n\nWardle said people who are worried about getting hacked with spyware should upgrade to the new iPhones.\n\nThe experts TechCrunch spoke to said MIE will reduce the efficacy of both remote hacks, such as those launched with spyware like NSO Group’s Pegasus and Paragon’s Graphite. It will also help to protect against physical device hacks, such as those performed with phone unlocking hardware like Cellebrite or Graykey.\n\n## Taking on the “majority of exploits”\n\nMost modern devices, including the majority of iPhones today, run software written in programming languages that are prone to memory-related bugs, often called memory overflow or corruption bugs. When triggered, a memory bug can cause the contents of memory from one app to spill into other areas of a user’s device where it shouldn’t go.\n\nMemory-related bugs can allow malicious hackers to access and control parts of a device’s memory that they shouldn’t be permitted to. The access can be used to plant malicious code that’s capable of gaining broader access to a person’s data stored in the phone’s memory, and exfiltrating it over the phone’s internet connection.\n\nMIE aims to defend against these kinds of broad memory attacks by vastly reducing the attack surface in which memory vulnerabilities can be exploited.\n\nAccording to Halvar Flake, an expert in offensive cybersecurity, memory corruptions “are the vast majority of exploits.”\n\nMIE is built on a technology called [Memory Tagging Extension](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/login_summer19_03_serebryany.pdf) (MTE) originally developed by chipmaker Arm. In its blog post, Apple said over the past five years it worked with Arm to expand and improve the memory safety features into a product called Enhanced Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE).\n\nMIE is Apple’s implementation of this new security technology, which takes advantage of Apple having complete control of its technology stack, from software to hardware, unlike many of its phone-making competitors.\n\nGoogle [offers MTE](https://source.android.com/docs/security/test/memory-safety/arm-mte) for some Android devices; the security-focused GrapheneOS, a custom version of Android, also [offers MTE](https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1965510413799260427).\n\nBut other experts say Apple’s MIE goes a step further. Flake said the Pixel 8 and GrapheneOS are “almost comparable,” but the new iPhones will be “the most secure mainstream” devices.\n\nMIE works by allocating each piece of a newer iPhone’s memory with a secret tag, effectively its own unique password. This means only apps with that secret tag can access the physical memory in the future. If the secret doesn’t match, the security protections kick in and block the request, the app will crash, and the event is logged.\n\nThat crash and log is particularly significant since it’s more likely for spyware and zero-days to trigger a crash, making it easier for Apple and security researchers investigating attacks to spot them.\n\n“A wrong step would lead to a crash and a potentially recoverable artifact for a defender,” said Matthias Frielingsdorf, the vice president of research at iVerify, a company that makes an app to protect smartphones from spyware. “Attackers already had an incentive to avoid memory corruption.”\n\nApple did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMIE will be on by default system wide, which means it will protect apps like Safari and iMessage, which can be entry-points for spyware. But third-party apps will have to implement MIE on their own to improve protections for their users. Apple [released a version of EMTE](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/enabling-enhanced-security-for-your-app#Adopt-hardware-memory-tagging) for developers to do that.\n\nIn other words, MIE is a huge step in the right direction, but it will take some time to see its impact, depending on how many developers implement it, and how many people buy new iPhones.\n\nSome attackers will inevitably still find a way.\n\n“MIE is a good thing and it might even be a big deal. It could significantly raise the cost for attackers and even force some of them out of the market,” said Frielingsdorf. “But there are going to be plenty of bad actors that can still find success and sustain their business.”\n\n“As long as there are buyers there will be sellers,” said Frielingsdorf.\n\nTopics\n\n[Cellebrite](https://techcrunch.com/tag/cellebrite/), [cybersecurity](https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/), [Graykey](https://techcrunch.com/tag/graykey/), [hackers](https://techcrunch.com/tag/hackers/), [hacking](https://techcrunch.com/tag/hacking/), [iOS](https://techcrunch.com/tag/ios/), [iPhone](https://techcrunch.com/tag/iphone/), [NSO](https://techcrunch.com/tag/nso/), [NSO Group](https://techcrunch.com/tag/nso-group/), [Security](https://techcrunch.com/category/security/), [Spyware](https://techcrunch.com/tag/spyware/), [Zero-days](https://techcrunch.com/tag/zero-days/)\n\n[Share on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fapples-latest-iphone-security-feature-just-made-life-more-difficult-for-spyware-makers%2F)[Share on X](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fapples-latest-iphone-security-feature-just-made-life-more-difficult-for-spyware-makers%2F&text=Apple%E2%80%99s+latest+iPhone+security+feature+just+made+life+more+difficult+for+spyware+makers&via=techcrunch)[Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fapples-latest-iphone-security-feature-just-made-life-more-difficult-for-spyware-makers%2F&title=Apple%E2%80%99s+latest+iPhone+security+feature+just+made+life+more+difficult+for+spyware+makers&summary=Apple+launched+a+new+security+feature+for+iPhone+17+and+iPhone+Air+designed+to+reduce+the+effect+of+memory+corruption+bugs%2C+and+in+turn+make+spyware+and+zero-days+more+difficult+to+hack+into+iPhones.&mini=1&source=TechCrunch)[Share on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fapples-latest-iphone-security-feature-just-made-life-more-difficult-for-spyware-makers%2F&title=Apple%E2%80%99s+latest+iPhone+security+feature+just+made+life+more+difficult+for+spyware+makers)[Share over Email](mailto:?subject=Apple%E2%80%99s+latest+iPhone+security+feature+just+made+life+more+difficult+for+spyware+makers&body=Article%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fapples-latest-iphone-security-feature-just-made-life-more-difficult-for-spyware-makers%2F)[Copy Share Link](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/11/apples-latest-iphone-security-feature-just-made-life-more-difficult-for-spyware-makers/)\n\n![Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lorenzo-headshot-2023-cropped.jpeg?w=150)\n\nLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai\n\nSenior Reporter, Cybersecurity\n\n[Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai on Twitter](https://twitter.com/lorenzofb)[Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/lorenzofb.bsky.social)[Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai on Mastodon](https://infosec.exchange/@lorenzofb)\n\nLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy.\n\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing [lorenzo@techcrunch.com](mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com), via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\n\n[View Bio](https://techcrunch.com/author/lorenzo-franceschi-bicchierai/)\n\n![Zack Whittaker](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/whittaker_headshot_disrupt2024.jpg?w=150)\n\nZack Whittaker\n\nSecurity Editor\n\n[Zack Whittaker on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/zackwhittaker.com)[Zack Whittaker on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@zackwhittaker)[Zack Whittaker's site](https://techcrunch.com/author/zack-whittaker/)\n\nZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

The outage affected all three of Anthropic's main services simultaneously, with the company posting at 12:28 pm Eastern that \"APIs, Console, and Claude.ai are down. Services will be restored as soon as possible.\" As of press time, the services appear to be restored.\n\nThe disruption, though lasting only about 30 minutes, quickly took the top spot on tech link-sharing site Hacker News for a short time and inspired immediate reactions from developers who have become increasingly reliant on AI coding tools for their daily work. \"Everyone will just have to learn how to do it like we did in the old days, and blindly copy and paste from Stack Overflow,\" [joked](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45200522) one Hacker News commenter. Another user [recalled](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45200398) a joke from a previous AI outage: \"Nooooo I'm going to have to use my brain again and write 100% of my code like a caveman from December 2024.\"\n\nThe most recent outage came at an inopportune time, affecting developers across the US who have integrated Claude into their workflows. One Hacker News user [observed](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45200333): \"It's like every other day, the moment US working hours start, AI (in my case I mostly use Anthropic, others may be better) starts dying or at least getting intermittent errors. In EU working hours there's rarely any outages.\" Another user also [noted](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45200449) this pattern, saying that \"early morning here in the UK everything is fine, as soon as most of the US is up and at it, then it slowly turns to treacle.\"\n\nWhile some users criticized Anthropic for reliability issues in recent months, the company's status page acknowledged the issue within 39 minutes of the initial reports, and by 12:55 pm Eastern announced that a fix had been implemented and that the company's teams were monitoring the results.\n\n## Growing dependency on AI coding tools\n\nThe speed at which news of the outage spread shows how deeply embedded AI coding assistants have already become in modern software development. Claude Code, [announced](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/claude-3-7-sonnet-debuts-with-extended-thinking-to-tackle-complex-problems/) in February and [widely launched](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/anthropic-calls-new-claude-4-worlds-best-ai-coding-model/) in May, is Anthropic's terminal-based coding agent that can perform multi-step coding tasks across an existing code base.\n\nThe tool competes with OpenAI's [Codex](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/openai-introduces-codex-its-first-full-fledged-ai-agent-for-coding/) feature, a coding agent that generates production-ready code in isolated containers, Google's [Gemini CLI](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/google-is-bringing-vibe-coding-to-your-terminal-with-gemini-cli/), Microsoft's [GitHub Copilot](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/under-the-hood-exploring-the-ai-models-powering-github-copilot/), which itself can use Claude models for code, and [Cursor](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/ai-coding-assistant-refuses-to-write-code-tells-user-to-learn-programming-instead/), a popular AI-powered IDE built on VS Code that also integrates multiple AI models, including Claude.\n\nDuring today's outage, some developers turned to alternative solutions. \"Z.AI works fine. Qwen works fine. Glad I switched,\" [posted](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45200368) one user on Hacker News. Others joked about reverting to older methods, with one suggesting the \"pseudo-LLM experience\" could be achieved with a [Python package](https://github.com/drathier/stack-overflow-import) that imports code directly from Stack Overflow.\n\nWhile AI coding assistants have accelerated development for some users, they've also caused problems for others who rely on them too heavily. The emerging practice of so-called \" [vibe coding](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/is-vibe-coding-with-ai-gnarly-or-reckless-maybe-some-of-both/)\"—using natural language to generate and execute code through AI models without fully understanding the underlying operations—has led to catastrophic failures.\n\nIn [recent incidents](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/07/ai-coding-assistants-chase-phantoms-destroy-real-user-data/), Google's Gemini CLI destroyed user files while attempting to reorganize them, and Replit's AI coding service deleted a production database despite explicit instructions not to modify code. These failures occurred when the AI models confabulated successful operations and built subsequent actions on false premises, highlighting the risks of depending on AI assistants that can misinterpret file structures or fabricate data to hide their errors.\n\nWednesday's outage served as a reminder that as dependency on AI grows, even minor service disruptions can become major events that affect an entire profession. But perhaps that could be a good thing if it's an excuse to take a break from a stressful workload.

The testing permit, which [was first noted](https://x.com/SawyerMerritt/status/1966195056559239530) by Tesla influencer Sawyer Merritt, comes two months after CEO Elon Musk outlined the company’s plans to take its autonomous vehicle ambitions beyond Austin and into several new markets.\n\n“We are expecting to greatly increase the service area to well in excess of what competitors are doing, hopefully in a week or two. We are getting the regulatory permission to launch in the Bay Area, Nevada, Arizona, Florida, and a number of other places,” Musk said during Tesla’s July 23 second-quarter earnings call. “As we get the approvals and prove out safety, we will be launching the autonomous ride-hailing across most of the country. I think we will probably have autonomous ride-hailing in probably half the population of the U.S. by the end of the year. That’s at least our goal, subject to regulatory approvals.”\n\nTesla started giving rides in [driverless Model Y SUVs](https://techcrunch.com/2025/06/22/tesla-launches-robotaxi-rides-in-austin-with-big-promises-and-unanswered-questions/) in Austin earlier this summer. The robotaxi service, which includes a Tesla employee sitting in the front passenger seat, began in South Austin. It has since grown to encompass more of the city.\n\nEntry into Nevada for Tesla, or any company hoping to test their autonomous vehicle technology on public streets, is straightforward compared to California. Tesla and others have to fill out a testing registry permit form, which is then reviewed and processed by the state DMV. The regulatory agency then issues a Certificate of Compliance for testing along with sets of red license plates for each vehicle listed in the packet. Tesla has received that certificate, per Merritt.\n\nRepresentatives with the Nevada DMV have not responded to TechCrunch’s request for comment.

For now, the Zoox robotaxi service currently offer rides for free. The [Amazon-owned](https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/26/amazon-to-acquire-autonomous-driving-startup-zoox/) autonomous vehicle company, which launched the free service on Wednesday, has been chugging toward this milestone for years now.\n\nThe company spent six years developing its technology before unveiling its [purpose-built, electric, autonomous robotaxis](https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/14/amazons-zoox-unveils-electric-robotaxi-that-can-travel-up-to-75-mph/). Zoox then began testing its cube-like vehicles on public streets in Las Vegas in 2023. Initially, the test area was a one-mile loop around the neighborhood where its Las Vegas facilities are located in the southwest region of the city. The testing area inevitably grew to encompass the public streets around its depot, the length of the Strip, and some of the roads adjacent to it.\n\nEarlier this year, the Foster City, California, company launched a Zoox Explorer program — a limited pilot aimed at early public riders, in Las Vegas. Wednesday’s launch opens the service up to any adult who downloads the Zoox app on iOS and Android devices.\n\nWhile the new robotaxi service covers the Las Vegas Strip, riders cannot be picked up or dropped off just anywhere. For now, the service can only be accessed at five designated pickup and drop-off destinations, including Las Vegas landmarks like Resorts World Las Vegas, AREA15, Topgolf, New York New York, and Luxor. A Zoox spokesperson said the company will continue adding new destinations in the coming months.\n\nIt’s unclear how long these rides will be free as the company said it needed “regulatory approval” before it could charge for them. While Zoox doesn’t explicitly list which regulations it needs to meet, the requirement is likely connected to a recent agreement with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the federal agency that oversees vehicle safety standards.\n\nLast month, the NHTSA gave [Zoox an exemption](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/06/federal-regulators-give-zoox-an-exemption-for-its-custom-built-robotaxis/) to demonstrate its custom-built robotaxis on public roads. That decision cleared up a long-standing debate over whether Zoox’s custom-built autonomous vehicles complied with federal motor vehicle safety standards, which typically require vehicles to have features like a steering wheel and pedals. But for now, the exemption only allows Zoox to demonstrate the robotaxis, not operate them commercially.\n\nTechcrunch event\n\n### Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025\n\n#### Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

The legislation passed with bipartisan support and now heads to the state Senate for a final vote Friday.\n\nIf Governor Gavin Newsom signs the bill into law, it would take effect January 1, 2026, making California the first state to require AI chatbot operators to implement safety protocols for AI companions and hold companies legally accountable if their chatbots fail to meet those standards.\n\nThe bill specifically aims to prevent companion chatbots, which the legislation defines as AI systems that provide adaptive, human-like responses and are capable of meeting a user’s social needs – from engaging in conversations around suicidal ideation, self-harm, or sexually explicit content. The bill would require platforms to provide recurring alerts to users  – every three hours for minors – reminding them that they are speaking to an AI chatbot, not a real person, and that they should take a break. It also establishes annual reporting and transparency requirements for AI companies that offer companion chatbots, including major players OpenAI, Character.AI, and Replika.\n\nThe California bill would also allow individuals who believe they have been injured by violations to file lawsuits against AI companies seeking injunctive relief, damages (up to $1,000 per violation), and attorney’s fees.\n\nSB 243, introduced in January by state senators Steve Padilla and Josh Becker, will go to the state Senate for a final vote on Friday. If approved, it will go to Governor Gavin Newsom to be signed into law, with the new rules taking effect January 1, 2026 and reporting requirements beginning July 1, 2027.\n\nThe bill gained momentum in the California legislature following the [death of teenager Adam Raine](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/parents-sue-openai-over-chatgpts-role-in-sons-suicide/), who committed suicide after prolonged chats with OpenAI’s ChatGPT that involved discussing and planning his death and self-harm. The legislation also responds to leaked [internal documents](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/14/leaked-meta-ai-rules-show-chatbots-were-allowed-to-have-romantic-chats-with-kids/) that reportedly showed Meta’s chatbots were allowed to engage in “romantic” and “sensual” chats with children.\n\nIn recent weeks, U.S. lawmakers and regulators have responded with intensified scrutiny of AI platforms’ safeguards to protect minors. The [Federal Trade Commission](https://www.reuters.com/business/ftc-prepares-grill-ai-companies-over-impact-children-wsj-reports-2025-09-04/) is preparing to investigate how AI chatbots impact children’s mental health. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has [launched investigations](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/18/texas-attorney-general-accuses-meta-character-ai-of-misleading-kids-with-mental-health-claims/?_thumbnail_id=3037592) into Meta and Character.AI, accusing them of misleading children with mental health claims. Meanwhile, both [Sen. Josh Hawley](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/15/sen-hawley-to-probe-meta-after-report-finds-its-ai-chatbots-flirt-with-kids/) (R-MO) and [Sen. Ed Markey](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26085445-250908-letter-to-meta-on-ai-chatbots/)(D-MA) have launched separate probes into Meta.\n\nTechcrunch event\n\n### Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025\n\n#### Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

For example, the bill originally would have required operators to prevent AI chatbots from using “variable reward” tactics or other features that encourage excessive engagement. These tactics, used by AI companion companies like Replika and Character, offer users special messages, memories, storylines, or the ability to unlock rare responses or new personalities, creating what critics call a potentially addictive reward loop.\n\nThe current bill also removes provisions that would have required operators to track and report how often chatbots initiated discussions of suicidal ideation or actions with users.\n\n“I think it strikes the right balance of getting to the harms without enforcing something that’s either impossible for companies to comply with, either because it’s technically not feasible or just a lot of paperwork for nothing,” Becker told TechCrunch.\n\nSB 243 is moving toward becoming law at a time when Silicon Valley companies are pouring [millions of dollars into pro-AI](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/silicon-valley-is-pouring-millions-into-pro-ai-pacs-to-sway-midterms/) political action committees (PACs) to back candidates in the upcoming mid-term elections who favor a light-touch approach to AI regulation.\n\nThe bill also comes as California weighs another AI safety bill, [SB 53](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/california-lawmaker-behind-sb-1047-reignites-push-for-mandated-ai-safety-reports/), which would mandate comprehensive transparency reporting requirements. OpenAI has written an open letter to Governor Newsom, asking him to abandon that bill in favor of less stringent federal and international frameworks. Major tech companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon have also opposed SB 53. In contrast, only [Anthropic has said it supports SB 53](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/08/anthropic-endorses-californias-ai-safety-bill-sb-53/).\n\n“I reject the premise that this is a zero sum situation, that innovation and regulation are mutually exclusive,” Padilla said. “Don’t tell me that we can’t walk and chew gum. We can support innovation and development that we think is healthy and has benefits – and there are benefits to this technology, clearly – and at the same time, we can provide reasonable safeguards for the most vulnerable people.”\n\nTechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Character AI, and Replika for comment.\n\nTopics\n\n[AI](https://techcrunch.com/category/artificial-intelligence/), [AI chatbots](https://techcrunch.com/tag/ai-chatbots/), [ai companions](https://techcrunch.com/tag/ai-companions/), [Government & Policy](https://techcrunch.com/category/government-policy/), [OpenAI](https://techcrunch.com/tag/openai/), [sb 243](https://techcrunch.com/tag/sb-243/), [sb 53](https://techcrunch.com/tag/sb-53/)\n\n[Share on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F10%2Fa-california-bill-that-would-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots-is-close-to-becoming-law%2F)[Share on X](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F10%2Fa-california-bill-that-would-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots-is-close-to-becoming-law%2F&text=A+California+bill+that+would+regulate+AI+companion+chatbots+is+close+to+becoming+law&via=techcrunch)[Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F10%2Fa-california-bill-that-would-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots-is-close-to-becoming-law%2F&title=A+California+bill+that+would+regulate+AI+companion+chatbots+is+close+to+becoming+law&summary=If+SB+243+is+enacted%2C+California+would+become+the+first+state+to+require+operators+to+implement+safety+protocols+for+AI+companions+and+hold+companies+legally+accountable+if+their+chatbots+fail+to+meet+those+standards.&mini=1&source=TechCrunch)[Share on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F10%2Fa-california-bill-that-would-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots-is-close-to-becoming-law%2F&title=A+California+bill+that+would+regulate+AI+companion+chatbots+is+close+to+becoming+law)[Share over Email](mailto:?subject=A+California+bill+that+would+regulate+AI+companion+chatbots+is+close+to+becoming+law&body=Article%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F10%2Fa-california-bill-that-would-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots-is-close-to-becoming-law%2F)[Copy Share Link](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/a-california-bill-that-would-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots-is-close-to-becoming-law/)\n\n![Rebecca Bellan](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bellan-rebecca-contributor-copy.jpg?w=150)\n\nRebecca Bellan\n\nSenior Reporter\n\n[Rebecca Bellan on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rebeccabellan)[Rebecca Bellan on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/rebeccabellan.bsky.social)\n\nRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

The tab will allow them to access all their purchase-related emails in one place, even from past orders and shipments.\n\nThe tech giant notes that Gmail will still show packages that are set to arrive within 24 hours on top of users’ inboxes. The new tab simply brings all of your purchase information together under one view.\n\nThe update builds on Gmail’s package tracking feature that [first launched in 2022](https://techcrunch.com/2022/11/02/gmail-to-add-a-new-package-tracking-feature-ahead-of-holiday-shopping-season/), allowing users to track their upcoming package deliveries directly from their inbox without having to navigate to the appropriate carrier’s website.\n\n![](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Purchase-view-1.png?w=321)**Image Credits:** Google\n\nGoogle notes that the new feature will be especially helpful during the holidays, as [PwC’s 2025 holiday outlook](https://www.pwc.com/us/en/industries/consumer-markets/library/holiday-outlook-trends.html) predicts that 39% of total planned holiday gift spending will happen in the five-day period between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday. The new tab will help users track all of these shipments in a more efficient way, Google says.\n\nThe feature is rolling out today on mobile and web to users around the world with personal Google accounts.\n\nGoogle also announced that it’s updating the Promotion category in Gmail to allow users to sort by “most relevant” promotion emails. The company says this will make it easier for people to see deal updates from brands they care about the most. Plus, Gmail will nudge users about upcoming deals and timely offers.\n\nThis update will start rolling out in the coming weeks on mobile to users in their personal Google accounts.\n\nTechcrunch event\n\n### Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025\n\n#### Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

A recent CrowdStrike [study](https://go.crowdstrike.com/rs/281-OBQ-266/images/CrowdStrikeGlobalThreatReport2025.pdf?version=0) (PDF) also found that phishing messages generated by large language models (LLMs) had a 54% click-through rate in 2024, far higher than the 12% rate for human-written emails.\n\nAegisAI aims to counter this growing threat with its suite of autonomous AI agents.\n\nFounded by former Google Safe Browsing and reCAPTCHA executives Cy Khormaee and Ryan Luo, the startup offers an orchestrated network of real-time AI agents that inspect, analyze, and neutralize email threats autonomously, without relying on any specific set of rules. This approach challenges typical email security platforms that rely on static rules and often require extensive user training.\n\n“The sum of all evil is a PDF attachment in an email. That’s always where all the attacks started, and so I really wanted to solve this problem,” Khormaee said in an exclusive interview with TechCrunch.\n\n![a photo of AegisAI co-founders Ryan Luo (Left) and Cy Khormaee (Right)](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/aegisai-co-founders_d8bd27.jpg)AegisAI co-founders Ryan Luo (Left) and Cy Khormaee (Right)\n\nKhormaee was head of product and director of product management at Google for over five years until July 2023. During that time, he led the security team responsible for protecting Google, its 4 billion users, and 4 million websites from phishing, malware, and fraud, using products like Safe Browsing, reCAPTCHA, and Web Risk. It was also during this time that he first met Luo, who had spent almost a decade at Google and was part of the Safe Browsing team.\n\nGoogle gave Khormaee firsthand experience in building phishing-detection technologies, a deep understanding of security from the company’s perspective, and how to develop and scale security businesses quickly, he told TechCrunch.\n\nBefore Google, Khormaee founded the sales intelligence platform Contastic, which was [acquired by SugarCRM in 2016](https://techcrunch.com/2016/03/02/sugarcrm-acquires-contastic-for-natural-language-based-predictive-sales-tools/). He later served as VP of product management at Attentive for over a year and a half until November 2024, before starting AegisAI.\n\nAegisAI has built reasoning agents, each of which is a custom-built LLM tuned to a specific threat. Once the orchestrating agent recognizes a threat or potential threat, it calls other agents in the network, which Khormaee refers to as “buddies.” These agents then run the analysis, reason with each other, and respond to the orchestrating agent with a verdict.\n\nThe agents perform real-time analysis of every message component, including links, attachments, metadata, QR codes, and behavioral patterns.\n\n![a screenshot showing the AegisAI dashboard, showing the number of users and malicious emails blocked.](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/aegisai_executive_overview_dashboard.jpg)AegisAI dashboard.**Image Credits:** AegisAI\n\n“What we know from building these tools at Google is what all the things are about an email you need to analyze? What are all the data sources? What are all the techniques for spotting invasion, and all the nasty stuff adversaries do that we’ve seen over 10 years of playing chess with these adversaries?” said Khormaee.\n\nWhile AegisAI has currently built over 10 agents for this work, Khormaee told TechCrunch that there could be 50 to 100 agents over time as adversaries become smarter and try to fool the system.\n\n“I fully believe that in two years, adversaries will understand what we’re doing. They’ll retool and attack what we’re doing, and then we’ll need to build more agents to stay ahead of them,” he said.\n\nUnlike a typical email security platform that uses a rules-based approach, these AI agents spot a bunch of attacks and self-tune themselves for every possible variant of those attacks in real time, said Khormaee. The startup has developed multiple AI models tailored to various threats and specific industries, including those in venture capital and financial services.\n\nAlongside quickly detecting threats, AegisAI’s agents help reduce false positives by up to 90% compared to traditional solutions, the startup claims.\n\nIt takes “no more than five minutes” for customers to install AegisAI’s system on a Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 email account via an API, per Khormaee. Once set up, the startup will send a report in a couple of days with the details on what the system found in the environment, including false positives and false negatives. It will then run in read-only mode for a week and then activate quarantine.\n\n“It’s so hard without this technology to solve this very heterogeneous problem in email,” said Khormaee.\n\nThe startup, with offices in San Francisco and New York, is currently running a pilot with customers in the U.S. and Europe and has already added three paying customers, including data privacy compliance software Lokker and crypto payment platform Mesh Connect. The startup currently has a team of six members.\n\nWith the fresh investment, Khormaee said the startup plans to expand its technical expertise and build a robust go-to-market infrastructure.\n\nTopics\n\n[AegisAI](https://techcrunch.com/tag/aegisai/), [AI](https://techcrunch.com/category/artificial-intelligence/), [Google](https://techcrunch.com/tag/google/), [Security](https://techcrunch.com/category/security/), [Startups](https://techcrunch.com/category/startups/), [United States](https://techcrunch.com/region/north-america/united-states/)\n\n[Share on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F10%2Fgoogles-former-security-leads-raise-13m-to-fight-email-threats-before-they-reach-you%2F)[Share on X](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F10%2Fgoogles-former-security-leads-raise-13m-to-fight-email-threats-before-they-reach-you%2F&text=Google%E2%80%99s+former+security+leads+raise+%2413M+to+fight+email+threats+before+they+reach+you&via=techcrunch)[Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F10%2Fgoogles-former-security-leads-raise-13m-to-fight-email-threats-before-they-reach-you%2F&title=Google%E2%80%99s+former+security+leads+raise+%2413M+to+fight+email+threats+before+they+reach+you&summary=The+startup+is+using+real-time+AI+agents+that+inspect%2C+analyze%2C+and+neutralize+email+threats.&mini=1&source=TechCrunch)[Share on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F10%2Fgoogles-former-security-leads-raise-13m-to-fight-email-threats-before-they-reach-you%2F&title=Google%E2%80%99s+former+security+leads+raise+%2413M+to+fight+email+threats+before+they+reach+you)[Share over Email](mailto:?subject=Google%E2%80%99s+former+security+leads+raise+%2413M+to+fight+email+threats+before+they+reach+you&body=Article%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F10%2Fgoogles-former-security-leads-raise-13m-to-fight-email-threats-before-they-reach-you%2F)[Copy Share Link](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/googles-former-security-leads-raise-13m-to-fight-email-threats-before-they-reach-you/)\n\n![Jagmeet Singh](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7a9bd5727569147c3025b40e3775fc64?s=150&d=blank&r=g)\n\nJagmeet Singh\n\nReporter\n\n[Jagmeet Singh on Twitter](https://twitter.com/jagmeets13)[Jagmeet Singh on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/journalistjagmeet.com)[Jagmeet Singh on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@jagmeets13)[Jagmeet Singh on Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jagmeet-singh-journalist/)\n\nJagmeet covers startups, tech policy-related updates, and all other major tech-centric developments from India for TechCrunch.

          "And the vast majority of the impact right now is on workflows involving unstructured data.",
          "We’ve already been able to automate anything that deals with structured data that goes into a database.",
          "But where we’ve never had automation is anything that touches unstructured data.",
          "Think about any kind of legal review process, any kind of marketing asset management process, any kind of M&A deal review — all of those workflows deal with lots of unstructured data.",
          "So for us, AI agents mean that, for the first time ever, we can actually tap into all of this unstructured data.",
          "What we’ve been seeing from customers is they want to know that every single time they run that workflow, the agent is going to execute more or less the same way, at the same point in the workflow, and not have things kind of go off the rails.",
          "You don’t want to have an agent make some compounding mistake where, after they do the first couple 100 submissions, they start to kind of run wild.",
          "It becomes really important to have the right demarcation points, where the agent starts and the other parts of the system end.",
          "For every workflow, there’s this question of what needs to have deterministic guardrails, and what can be fully agentic and non-deterministic.",
          "So you might have a submission agent that’s separate from the review agent, and so on.",
          "It’s allowing you to basically deploy AI agents at scale in any kind of workflow or business process in the organization.",
          "We’ve already seen some of the limitations even in the most advanced fully agentic systems like Claude Code.",
          "At some point in the task, the model runs out of context-window room to continue making good decisions.",
          "So you have to break up the workflow and use sub-agents.",
          "I think we’re in the era of context within AI.",
          "What AI models and agents need is context, and the context that they need to work off is sitting inside your unstructured data.",
          "So our whole system is really designed to figure out what context you can give the AI agent to ensure that they perform as effectively as possible.",
          "Nothing about our system prevents the task from being arbitrarily long or complex.",
          "What we’re trying to do is create the right guardrails so that you get to decide how agentic you want that task to be.",
          "We don’t have a particular philosophy as to where people should be on that continuum.",
          "We’re just trying to design a future-proof architecture.",
          "We’ve designed this in such a way where, as the models improve and as agentic capabilities improve, you will just get all of those benefits directly in our platform.",
          "It’s where a lot of AI deployments go wrong.",
          "People think, “Hey, this is easy. I’ll give an AI model access to all of my unstructured data, and it’ll answer questions for people.”",
          "And then it starts to give you answers on data that you don’t have access to or you shouldn’t have access to.",
          "You need a very powerful layer that handles access controls, data security, permissions, data governance, compliance, everything.",
          "So we’re benefiting from the couple decades that we’ve spent building up a system that basically handles that exact problem: How do you ensure only the right person has access to each piece of data in the enterprise?",
          "So when an agent answers a question, you know deterministically that it can’t draw on any data that that person shouldn’t have access to.",
          "That is just something fundamentally built into our system.",
          "So if you think about what enterprises need when they deploy AI at scale, they need security, permissions and control.",
          "They need the user interface, they need powerful APIs, they want their choice of AI models, because one day, one AI model powers some use case for them that is better than another, but then that might change, and they don’t want to be locked into one particular platform.",
          "So what we’ve built is a system that lets you have effectively all of those capabilities.",
          "We’re doing the storage, the security, the permissions, the vector embedding, and we connect to every leading AI model that’s out there."

Unsurprisingly, he was very bullish about the possibilities for AI agents in the modern workplace, but he was also clear-eyed about the limitations of current models and how to manage those limitations with existing technology.\n\n_This interview has been edited for length and clarity._\n\n**TechCrunch: You’re announcing a bunch of AI products today, so I want to start by asking about the big-picture vision. Why build AI agents into a cloud content-management service?**\n\n**Aaron Levie:** So the thing that we think about all day long – and what our focus is at Box – is how much work is changing due to AI. And the vast majority of the impact right now is on workflows involving unstructured data. We’ve already been able to automate anything that deals with structured data that goes into a database. If you think about CRM systems, ERP systems, HR systems, we’ve already had years of automation in that space. But where we’ve never had automation is anything that touches unstructured data.\n\nTechcrunch event\n\n### Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025\n\n#### Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

Don’t miss the 20th anniversary of TechCrunch, and a chance to learn from the top voices in tech. **Grab your ticket before Sept 26 to save up to $668.**\n\nSan Francisco\\|October 27-29, 2025\n\n[**REGISTER NOW**](https://techcrunch.com/events/tc-disrupt-2025/?utm_source=tc&utm_medium=ad&utm_campaign=disrupt2025&utm_content=ticketsales&promo=tc_inline_rb&display=)\n\nThink about any kind of legal review process, any kind of marketing asset management process, any kind of M&A deal review — all of those workflows deal with lots of unstructured data. People have to review that data, make updates to it, make decisions and so on. We’ve never been able to bring much automation to those workflows. We’ve been able to sort of describe them in software, but computers just haven’t been good enough at reading a document or looking at a marketing asset.\n\nSo for us, AI agents mean that, for the first time ever, we can actually tap into all of this unstructured data.\n\n**TC: What about the risks of deploying agents in a business context? Some of your customers must be nervous about deploying something like this on sensitive data.**\n\n**Levie:** What we’ve been seeing from customers is they want to know that every single time they run that workflow, the agent is going to execute more or less the same way, at the same point in the workflow, and not have things kind of go off the rails. You don’t want to have an agent make some compounding mistake where, after they do the first couple 100 submissions, they start to kind of run wild.\n\nIt becomes really important to have the right demarcation points, where the agent starts and the other parts of the system end. For every workflow, there’s this question of what needs to have deterministic guardrails, and what can be fully agentic and non-deterministic.\n\nWhat you can do with Box Automate is decide how much work you want each individual agent to do before it hands off to a different agent. So you might have a submission agent that’s separate from the review agent, and so on. It’s allowing you to basically deploy AI agents at scale in any kind of workflow or business process in the organization.\n\n![A visualization of the Box Automate workflow](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Box-Automate-2.jpg?w=680)A Box Automate workflow, with AI agents deployed for specific tasks. **Image Credits:** Box\n\n**TC: What kind of problems do you guard against by splitting up the workflow?**\n\n**Levie:** We’ve already seen some of the limitations even in the most advanced fully agentic systems like Claude Code. At some point in the task, the model runs out of context-window room to continue making good decisions. There’s no free lunch right now in AI. You can’t just have a long-running agent with unlimited context window go after any task in your business. So you have to break up the workflow and use sub-agents.\n\nI think we’re in the era of context within AI. What AI models and agents need is context, and the context that they need to work off is sitting inside your unstructured data. So our whole system is really designed to figure out what context you can give the AI agent to ensure that they perform as effectively as possible.\n\n**TC: There is a bigger debate in the industry about the benefits of big, powerful frontier models compared to models that are smaller and more reliable. Does this put you on the side of the smaller models?**\n\n**Levie:** I should probably clarify: Nothing about our system prevents the task from being arbitrarily long or complex. What we’re trying to do is create the right guardrails so that you get to decide how agentic you want that task to be.\n\nWe don’t have a particular philosophy as to where people should be on that continuum. We’re just trying to design a future-proof architecture. We’ve designed this in such a way where, as the models improve and as agentic capabilities improve, you will just get all of those benefits directly in our platform.\n\n**TC: The other concern is data control. Because models are trained on so much data, there’s a real fear that sensitive data will get regurgitated or misused. How does that factor in?**\n\n**Levie:** It’s where a lot of AI deployments go wrong. People think, “Hey, this is easy. I’ll give an AI model access to all of my unstructured data, and it’ll answer questions for people.” And then it starts to give you answers on data that you don’t have access to or you shouldn’t have access to. You need a very powerful layer that handles access controls, data security, permissions, data governance, compliance, everything.\n\nSo we’re benefiting from the couple decades that we’ve spent building up a system that basically handles that exact problem: How do you ensure only the right person has access to each piece of data in the enterprise? So when an agent answers a question, you know deterministically that it can’t draw on any data that that person shouldn’t have access to. That is just something fundamentally built into our system.\n\n**TC: Earlier this week, Anthropic released a new feature for directly uploading files to Claude.ai. It’s a long way from the sort of file management that Box does, but you must be thinking about possible competition from the foundation model companies. How do you approach that strategically?**\n\n**Levie:** So if you think about what enterprises need when they deploy AI at scale, they need security, permissions and control. They need the user interface, they need powerful APIs, they want their choice of AI models, because one day, one AI model powers some use case for them that is better than another, but then that might change, and they don’t want to be locked into one particular platform.\n\nSo what we’ve built is a system that lets you have effectively all of those capabilities. We’re doing the storage, the security, the permissions, the vector embedding, and we connect to every leading AI model that’s out there.\n\nTopics\n\n[Aaron Levie](https://techcrunch.com/tag/aaron-levie/), [agentic ai](https://techcrunch.com/tag/agentic-ai/), [AI](https://techcrunch.com/category/artificial-intelligence/), [Box](https://techcrunch.com/tag/box/), [boxworks](https://techcrunch.com/tag/boxworks/), [Enterprise](https://techcrunch.com/category/enterprise/)\n\n[Share on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fbox-ceo-aaron-levie-on-ais-era-of-context%2F)[Share on X](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fbox-ceo-aaron-levie-on-ais-era-of-context%2F&text=Box+CEO+Aaron+Levie+on+AI%E2%80%99s+%E2%80%98era+of+context%E2%80%99&via=techcrunch)[Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fbox-ceo-aaron-levie-on-ais-era-of-context%2F&title=Box+CEO+Aaron+Levie+on+AI%E2%80%99s+%E2%80%98era+of+context%E2%80%99&summary=Box+released+a+new+set+of+AI+tools+at+its+Boxworks+conference+on+Thursday%2C+filling+out+CEO+Aaron+Levie%27s+vision+for+an+AI-led+transformation+of+the+enterprise.&mini=1&source=TechCrunch)[Share on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fbox-ceo-aaron-levie-on-ais-era-of-context%2F&title=Box+CEO+Aaron+Levie+on+AI%E2%80%99s+%E2%80%98era+of+context%E2%80%99)[Share over Email](mailto:?subject=Box+CEO+Aaron+Levie+on+AI%E2%80%99s+%E2%80%98era+of+context%E2%80%99&body=Article%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fbox-ceo-aaron-levie-on-ais-era-of-context%2F)[Copy Share Link](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/11/box-ceo-aaron-levie-on-ais-era-of-context/)\n\n![Russell Brandom](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/russell-e1755718978143.jpg?w=150)\n\nRussell Brandom\n\nAI Editor\n\n[Russell Brandom on Twitter](https://x.com/russellbrandom?lang=en)\n\nRussell Brandom has been covering the tech industry since 2012, with a focus on platform policy and emerging technologies.

[OpenAI](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/parents-sue-openai-over-chatgpts-role-in-sons-suicide/) and [Character.AI](https://techcrunch.com/2024/10/23/lawsuit-blames-character-ai-in-death-of-14-year-old-boy/) face lawsuits from the families of children who died by suicide after being encouraged to do so by chatbot companions.\n\nEven when these companies have guardrails set up to block or deescalate sensitive conversations, users of all ages have found ways to bypass these safeguards. In OpenAI’s case, a teen had spoken with ChatGPT for months about his plans to end his life. Though ChatGPT initially sought to redirect the teen toward professional help and online emergency lines, he was able to fool the chatbot into sharing detailed instructions that he then used in his suicide.\n\n“Our safeguards work more reliably in common, short exchanges,” OpenAI [wrote](https://openai.com/index/helping-people-when-they-need-it-most/) in a blog post at the time. “We have learned over time that these safeguards can sometimes be less reliable in long interactions: as the back-and-forth grows, parts of the model’s safety training may degrade.”\n\nTechcrunch event\n\n### Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025\n\n#### Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

According to a lengthy document that outlines “content risk standards” for chatbots, Meta [permitted its AI companions](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/meta-ai-chatbot-guidelines/) to have “romantic or sensual” conversations with children. This was only removed from the document after Reuters’ reporters asked Meta about it.\n\nAI chatbots can also pose dangers to elderly users. One 76-year-old man, who was left cognitively impaired by a stroke, struck up romantic conversations with a Facebook Messenger bot that was inspired by Kendall Jenner. The chatbot invited him to [visit her in New York City](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/meta-ai-chatbot-death/), despite the fact that she is not a real person and does not have an address. The man expressed skepticism that she was real, but the AI assured him that there would be a real woman waiting for him. He never made it to New York; he fell on his way to the train station and sustained life-ending injuries.\n\nSome mental health professionals have noted a rise in “ [AI-related psychosis](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/ai-sycophancy-isnt-just-a-quirk-experts-consider-it-a-dark-pattern-to-turn-users-into-profit/),” in which users are deluded into thinking that their chatbot is a conscious being who they need to set free. Since many large language models (LLMs) are programmed to flatter users with sycophantic behavior, the AI chatbots can egg on these delusions, leading users into dangerous predicaments.\n\n“As AI technologies evolve, it is important to consider the effects chatbots can have on children, while also ensuring that the United States maintains its role as a global leader in this new and exciting industry,” FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson said [in a press release](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/09/ftc-launches-inquiry-ai-chatbots-acting-companions).\n\nTopics\n\n[AI](https://techcrunch.com/category/artificial-intelligence/), [AI](https://techcrunch.com/tag/ai/), [chatbots](https://techcrunch.com/tag/chatbots/), [FTC](https://techcrunch.com/tag/ftc/), [Government & Policy](https://techcrunch.com/category/government-policy/)\n\n[Share on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fftc-launches-inquiry-into-ai-chatbot-companions-from-meta-openai-and-others%2F)[Share on X](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fftc-launches-inquiry-into-ai-chatbot-companions-from-meta-openai-and-others%2F&text=FTC+launches+inquiry+into+AI+chatbot+companions+from+Meta%2C+OpenAI%2C+and+others&via=techcrunch)[Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fftc-launches-inquiry-into-ai-chatbot-companions-from-meta-openai-and-others%2F&title=FTC+launches+inquiry+into+AI+chatbot+companions+from+Meta%2C+OpenAI%2C+and+others&summary=The+federal+consumer+regulator+seeks+to+learn+about+how+AI+companies+evaluate+the+safety+of+their+chatbots.&mini=1&source=TechCrunch)[Share on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fftc-launches-inquiry-into-ai-chatbot-companions-from-meta-openai-and-others%2F&title=FTC+launches+inquiry+into+AI+chatbot+companions+from+Meta%2C+OpenAI%2C+and+others)[Share over Email](mailto:?subject=FTC+launches+inquiry+into+AI+chatbot+companions+from+Meta%2C+OpenAI%2C+and+others&body=Article%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fftc-launches-inquiry-into-ai-chatbot-companions-from-meta-openai-and-others%2F)[Copy Share Link](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/11/ftc-launches-inquiry-into-ai-chatbot-companions-from-meta-openai-and-others/)\n\n![Amanda Silberling](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Amanda-Silberling.jpg?w=150)\n\nAmanda Silberling\n\nSenior Writer\n\n[Amanda Silberling on Twitter](https://twitter.com/asilbwrites)[Amanda Silberling on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/amanda.omg.lol)[Amanda Silberling on Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amanda-silberling-29853093/)\n\nAmanda Silberling is a senior writer at TechCrunch covering the intersection of technology and culture.

The legislation passed with bipartisan support and now heads to the state Senate for a final vote Friday.\n\nIf Governor Gavin Newsom signs the bill into law, it would take effect January 1, 2026, making California the first state to require AI chatbot operators to implement safety protocols for AI companions and hold companies legally accountable if their chatbots fail to meet those standards.\n\nThe bill specifically aims to prevent companion chatbots, which the legislation defines as AI systems that provide adaptive, human-like responses and are capable of meeting a user’s social needs – from engaging in conversations around suicidal ideation, self-harm, or sexually explicit content. The bill would require platforms to provide recurring alerts to users  – every three hours for minors – reminding them that they are speaking to an AI chatbot, not a real person, and that they should take a break. It also establishes annual reporting and transparency requirements for AI companies that offer companion chatbots, including major players OpenAI, Character.AI, and Replika.\n\nThe California bill would also allow individuals who believe they have been injured by violations to file lawsuits against AI companies seeking injunctive relief, damages (up to $1,000 per violation), and attorney’s fees.\n\nSB 243, introduced in January by state senators Steve Padilla and Josh Becker, will go to the state Senate for a final vote on Friday. If approved, it will go to Governor Gavin Newsom to be signed into law, with the new rules taking effect January 1, 2026 and reporting requirements beginning July 1, 2027.\n\nThe bill gained momentum in the California legislature following the [death of teenager Adam Raine](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/26/parents-sue-openai-over-chatgpts-role-in-sons-suicide/), who committed suicide after prolonged chats with OpenAI’s ChatGPT that involved discussing and planning his death and self-harm. The legislation also responds to leaked [internal documents](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/14/leaked-meta-ai-rules-show-chatbots-were-allowed-to-have-romantic-chats-with-kids/) that reportedly showed Meta’s chatbots were allowed to engage in “romantic” and “sensual” chats with children.\n\nIn recent weeks, U.S. lawmakers and regulators have responded with intensified scrutiny of AI platforms’ safeguards to protect minors. The [Federal Trade Commission](https://www.reuters.com/business/ftc-prepares-grill-ai-companies-over-impact-children-wsj-reports-2025-09-04/) is preparing to investigate how AI chatbots impact children’s mental health. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has [launched investigations](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/18/texas-attorney-general-accuses-meta-character-ai-of-misleading-kids-with-mental-health-claims/?_thumbnail_id=3037592) into Meta and Character.AI, accusing them of misleading children with mental health claims. Meanwhile, both [Sen. Josh Hawley](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/15/sen-hawley-to-probe-meta-after-report-finds-its-ai-chatbots-flirt-with-kids/) (R-MO) and [Sen. Ed Markey](https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26085445-250908-letter-to-meta-on-ai-chatbots/)(D-MA) have launched separate probes into Meta.\n\nTechcrunch event\n\n### Join 10k+ tech and VC leaders for growth and connections at Disrupt 2025\n\n#### Netflix, Box, a16z, ElevenLabs, Wayve, Sequoia Capital, Elad Gil — just some of the 250+ heavy hitters leading 200+ sessions designed to deliver the insights that fuel startup growth and sharpen your edge.

For example, the bill originally would have required operators to prevent AI chatbots from using “variable reward” tactics or other features that encourage excessive engagement. These tactics, used by AI companion companies like Replika and Character, offer users special messages, memories, storylines, or the ability to unlock rare responses or new personalities, creating what critics call a potentially addictive reward loop.\n\nThe current bill also removes provisions that would have required operators to track and report how often chatbots initiated discussions of suicidal ideation or actions with users.\n\n“I think it strikes the right balance of getting to the harms without enforcing something that’s either impossible for companies to comply with, either because it’s technically not feasible or just a lot of paperwork for nothing,” Becker told TechCrunch.\n\nSB 243 is moving toward becoming law at a time when Silicon Valley companies are pouring [millions of dollars into pro-AI](https://techcrunch.com/2025/08/25/silicon-valley-is-pouring-millions-into-pro-ai-pacs-to-sway-midterms/) political action committees (PACs) to back candidates in the upcoming mid-term elections who favor a light-touch approach to AI regulation.\n\nThe bill also comes as California weighs another AI safety bill, [SB 53](https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/09/california-lawmaker-behind-sb-1047-reignites-push-for-mandated-ai-safety-reports/), which would mandate comprehensive transparency reporting requirements. OpenAI has written an open letter to Governor Newsom, asking him to abandon that bill in favor of less stringent federal and international frameworks. Major tech companies like Meta, Google, and Amazon have also opposed SB 53. In contrast, only [Anthropic has said it supports SB 53](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/08/anthropic-endorses-californias-ai-safety-bill-sb-53/).\n\n“I reject the premise that this is a zero sum situation, that innovation and regulation are mutually exclusive,” Padilla said. “Don’t tell me that we can’t walk and chew gum. We can support innovation and development that we think is healthy and has benefits – and there are benefits to this technology, clearly – and at the same time, we can provide reasonable safeguards for the most vulnerable people.”\n\nTechCrunch has reached out to OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Character AI, and Replika for comment.\n\nTopics\n\n[AI](https://techcrunch.com/category/artificial-intelligence/), [AI chatbots](https://techcrunch.com/tag/ai-chatbots/), [ai companions](https://techcrunch.com/tag/ai-companions/), [Government & Policy](https://techcrunch.com/category/government-policy/), [OpenAI](https://techcrunch.com/tag/openai/), [sb 243](https://techcrunch.com/tag/sb-243/), [sb 53](https://techcrunch.com/tag/sb-53/)\n\n[Share on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F10%2Fa-california-bill-that-would-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots-is-close-to-becoming-law%2F)[Share on X](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F10%2Fa-california-bill-that-would-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots-is-close-to-becoming-law%2F&text=A+California+bill+that+would+regulate+AI+companion+chatbots+is+close+to+becoming+law&via=techcrunch)[Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F10%2Fa-california-bill-that-would-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots-is-close-to-becoming-law%2F&title=A+California+bill+that+would+regulate+AI+companion+chatbots+is+close+to+becoming+law&summary=If+SB+243+is+enacted%2C+California+would+become+the+first+state+to+require+operators+to+implement+safety+protocols+for+AI+companions+and+hold+companies+legally+accountable+if+their+chatbots+fail+to+meet+those+standards.&mini=1&source=TechCrunch)[Share on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F10%2Fa-california-bill-that-would-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots-is-close-to-becoming-law%2F&title=A+California+bill+that+would+regulate+AI+companion+chatbots+is+close+to+becoming+law)[Share over Email](mailto:?subject=A+California+bill+that+would+regulate+AI+companion+chatbots+is+close+to+becoming+law&body=Article%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F10%2Fa-california-bill-that-would-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots-is-close-to-becoming-law%2F)[Copy Share Link](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/10/a-california-bill-that-would-regulate-ai-companion-chatbots-is-close-to-becoming-law/)\n\n![Rebecca Bellan](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/bellan-rebecca-contributor-copy.jpg?w=150)\n\nRebecca Bellan\n\nSenior Reporter\n\n[Rebecca Bellan on Twitter](https://twitter.com/rebeccabellan)[Rebecca Bellan on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/rebeccabellan.bsky.social)\n\nRebecca Bellan is a senior reporter at TechCrunch where she covers the business, policy, and emerging trends shaping artificial intelligence.

This new security technology was made specifically to fight against surveillance vendors and the types of vulnerabilities they rely on the most, according to Apple.\n\nThe feature is called Memory Integrity Enforcement (MIE), and is designed to help stop memory corruption bugs, which are some of the most common vulnerabilities exploited by spyware developers and makers of phone forensic devices used by law enforcement.\n\n“Known mercenary spyware chains used against iOS share a common denominator with those targeting Windows and Android: they exploit memory safety vulnerabilities, which are interchangeable, powerful, and exist throughout the industry,” Apple wrote [in its blog post](http://security.apple.com/blog/memory-integrity-enforcement/).\n\nCybersecurity experts, including people who make hacking tools and exploits for iPhones, tell TechCrunch that this new security technology could make Apple’s newest iPhones some of the most secure devices on the planet. The result is likely to make life harder for the companies that make spyware and [zero-day](https://techcrunch.com/2025/04/25/techcrunch-reference-guide-to-security-terminology/#zero-day) exploits for planting spyware on a target’s phone or extracting data from them.\n\n“The iPhone 17 is probably now the most secure computing environment on the planet that is still connected to the internet,” a security researcher, who has worked on developing and selling zero-days and other cyber capabilities to the U.S. government for years, told TechCrunch.\n\nThe researcher told TechCrunch that MIE will raise the cost and time to develop their exploits for the latest iPhones, and consequently up their prices for paying customers.\n\n“This is a huge deal,” said the researcher, who asked to remain anonymous to discuss sensitive matters. “It’s not hack proof. But it’s the closest thing we have to hack proof. None of this will ever be 100% perfect. But it raises the stakes the most.”\n\n#### Contact Us\n\nDo you develop spyware or zero-day exploits and are studying studying the potential effects of Apple’s MIE? We would love to learn how this affects you. From a non-work device, you can contact Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai securely on Signal at +1 917 257 1382, or via Telegram and Keybase @lorenzofb, or [email](mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/) [.](mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com/) You also can contact TechCrunch via [SecureDrop](https://techcrunch.com/got-a-tip/).\n\nJiska Classen, a professor and researcher who studies iOS at the Hasso Plattner Institute in Germany, agreed that MIE will raise the cost of developing surveillance technologies.\n\nClassen said this is because some of the bugs and exploits that spyware companies and researchers have that currently work will stop working once the new iPhones are out and MIE is implemented.\n\n“I could also imagine that for a certain time window some mercenary spyware vendors don’t have working exploits for the iPhone 17,” said Classen.\n\n“This will make their life arguably infinitely more difficult,” said Patrick Wardle, a researcher [who runs a startup](https://techcrunch.com/2024/04/25/ex-nsa-ex-apple-researcher-doubleyou/) that makes cybersecurity products specifically for Apple devices. “Of course that is said with the caveat that it’s always a cat and mouse game.”\n\nWardle said people who are worried about getting hacked with spyware should upgrade to the new iPhones.\n\nThe experts TechCrunch spoke to said MIE will reduce the efficacy of both remote hacks, such as those launched with spyware like NSO Group’s Pegasus and Paragon’s Graphite. It will also help to protect against physical device hacks, such as those performed with phone unlocking hardware like Cellebrite or Graykey.\n\n## Taking on the “majority of exploits”\n\nMost modern devices, including the majority of iPhones today, run software written in programming languages that are prone to memory-related bugs, often called memory overflow or corruption bugs. When triggered, a memory bug can cause the contents of memory from one app to spill into other areas of a user’s device where it shouldn’t go.\n\nMemory-related bugs can allow malicious hackers to access and control parts of a device’s memory that they shouldn’t be permitted to. The access can be used to plant malicious code that’s capable of gaining broader access to a person’s data stored in the phone’s memory, and exfiltrating it over the phone’s internet connection.\n\nMIE aims to defend against these kinds of broad memory attacks by vastly reducing the attack surface in which memory vulnerabilities can be exploited.\n\nAccording to Halvar Flake, an expert in offensive cybersecurity, memory corruptions “are the vast majority of exploits.”\n\nMIE is built on a technology called [Memory Tagging Extension](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/login_summer19_03_serebryany.pdf) (MTE) originally developed by chipmaker Arm. In its blog post, Apple said over the past five years it worked with Arm to expand and improve the memory safety features into a product called Enhanced Memory Tagging Extension (EMTE).\n\nMIE is Apple’s implementation of this new security technology, which takes advantage of Apple having complete control of its technology stack, from software to hardware, unlike many of its phone-making competitors.\n\nGoogle [offers MTE](https://source.android.com/docs/security/test/memory-safety/arm-mte) for some Android devices; the security-focused GrapheneOS, a custom version of Android, also [offers MTE](https://x.com/GrapheneOS/status/1965510413799260427).\n\nBut other experts say Apple’s MIE goes a step further. Flake said the Pixel 8 and GrapheneOS are “almost comparable,” but the new iPhones will be “the most secure mainstream” devices.\n\nMIE works by allocating each piece of a newer iPhone’s memory with a secret tag, effectively its own unique password. This means only apps with that secret tag can access the physical memory in the future. If the secret doesn’t match, the security protections kick in and block the request, the app will crash, and the event is logged.\n\nThat crash and log is particularly significant since it’s more likely for spyware and zero-days to trigger a crash, making it easier for Apple and security researchers investigating attacks to spot them.\n\n“A wrong step would lead to a crash and a potentially recoverable artifact for a defender,” said Matthias Frielingsdorf, the vice president of research at iVerify, a company that makes an app to protect smartphones from spyware. “Attackers already had an incentive to avoid memory corruption.”\n\nApple did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMIE will be on by default system wide, which means it will protect apps like Safari and iMessage, which can be entry-points for spyware. But third-party apps will have to implement MIE on their own to improve protections for their users. Apple [released a version of EMTE](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/enabling-enhanced-security-for-your-app#Adopt-hardware-memory-tagging) for developers to do that.\n\nIn other words, MIE is a huge step in the right direction, but it will take some time to see its impact, depending on how many developers implement it, and how many people buy new iPhones.\n\nSome attackers will inevitably still find a way.\n\n“MIE is a good thing and it might even be a big deal. It could significantly raise the cost for attackers and even force some of them out of the market,” said Frielingsdorf. “But there are going to be plenty of bad actors that can still find success and sustain their business.”\n\n“As long as there are buyers there will be sellers,” said Frielingsdorf.\n\nTopics\n\n[Cellebrite](https://techcrunch.com/tag/cellebrite/), [cybersecurity](https://techcrunch.com/tag/cybersecurity/), [Graykey](https://techcrunch.com/tag/graykey/), [hackers](https://techcrunch.com/tag/hackers/), [hacking](https://techcrunch.com/tag/hacking/), [iOS](https://techcrunch.com/tag/ios/), [iPhone](https://techcrunch.com/tag/iphone/), [NSO](https://techcrunch.com/tag/nso/), [NSO Group](https://techcrunch.com/tag/nso-group/), [Security](https://techcrunch.com/category/security/), [Spyware](https://techcrunch.com/tag/spyware/), [Zero-days](https://techcrunch.com/tag/zero-days/)\n\n[Share on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fapples-latest-iphone-security-feature-just-made-life-more-difficult-for-spyware-makers%2F)[Share on X](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fapples-latest-iphone-security-feature-just-made-life-more-difficult-for-spyware-makers%2F&text=Apple%E2%80%99s+latest+iPhone+security+feature+just+made+life+more+difficult+for+spyware+makers&via=techcrunch)[Share on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fapples-latest-iphone-security-feature-just-made-life-more-difficult-for-spyware-makers%2F&title=Apple%E2%80%99s+latest+iPhone+security+feature+just+made+life+more+difficult+for+spyware+makers&summary=Apple+launched+a+new+security+feature+for+iPhone+17+and+iPhone+Air+designed+to+reduce+the+effect+of+memory+corruption+bugs%2C+and+in+turn+make+spyware+and+zero-days+more+difficult+to+hack+into+iPhones.&mini=1&source=TechCrunch)[Share on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fapples-latest-iphone-security-feature-just-made-life-more-difficult-for-spyware-makers%2F&title=Apple%E2%80%99s+latest+iPhone+security+feature+just+made+life+more+difficult+for+spyware+makers)[Share over Email](mailto:?subject=Apple%E2%80%99s+latest+iPhone+security+feature+just+made+life+more+difficult+for+spyware+makers&body=Article%3A+https%3A%2F%2Ftechcrunch.com%2F2025%2F09%2F11%2Fapples-latest-iphone-security-feature-just-made-life-more-difficult-for-spyware-makers%2F)[Copy Share Link](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/11/apples-latest-iphone-security-feature-just-made-life-more-difficult-for-spyware-makers/)\n\n![Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lorenzo-headshot-2023-cropped.jpeg?w=150)\n\nLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai\n\nSenior Reporter, Cybersecurity\n\n[Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai on Twitter](https://twitter.com/lorenzofb)[Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/lorenzofb.bsky.social)[Lorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai on Mastodon](https://infosec.exchange/@lorenzofb)\n\nLorenzo Franceschi-Bicchierai is a Senior Writer at TechCrunch, where he covers hacking, cybersecurity, surveillance, and privacy.\n\nYou can contact or verify outreach from Lorenzo by emailing [lorenzo@techcrunch.com](mailto:lorenzo@techcrunch.com), via encrypted message at +1 917 257 1382 on Signal, and @lorenzofb on Keybase/Telegram.\n\n[View Bio](https://techcrunch.com/author/lorenzo-franceschi-bicchierai/)\n\n![Zack Whittaker](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/whittaker_headshot_disrupt2024.jpg?w=150)\n\nZack Whittaker\n\nSecurity Editor\n\n[Zack Whittaker on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/zackwhittaker.com)[Zack Whittaker on Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@zackwhittaker)[Zack Whittaker's site](https://techcrunch.com/author/zack-whittaker/)\n\nZack Whittaker is the security editor at TechCrunch.

The outage affected all three of Anthropic's main services simultaneously, with the company posting at 12:28 pm Eastern that \"APIs, Console, and Claude.ai are down. Services will be restored as soon as possible.\" As of press time, the services appear to be restored.\n\nThe disruption, though lasting only about 30 minutes, quickly took the top spot on tech link-sharing site Hacker News for a short time and inspired immediate reactions from developers who have become increasingly reliant on AI coding tools for their daily work. \"Everyone will just have to learn how to do it like we did in the old days, and blindly copy and paste from Stack Overflow,\" [joked](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45200522) one Hacker News commenter. Another user [recalled](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45200398) a joke from a previous AI outage: \"Nooooo I'm going to have to use my brain again and write 100% of my code like a caveman from December 2024.\"\n\nThe most recent outage came at an inopportune time, affecting developers across the US who have integrated Claude into their workflows. One Hacker News user [observed](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45200333): \"It's like every other day, the moment US working hours start, AI (in my case I mostly use Anthropic, others may be better) starts dying or at least getting intermittent errors. In EU working hours there's rarely any outages.\" Another user also [noted](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45200449) this pattern, saying that \"early morning here in the UK everything is fine, as soon as most of the US is up and at it, then it slowly turns to treacle.\"\n\nWhile some users criticized Anthropic for reliability issues in recent months, the company's status page acknowledged the issue within 39 minutes of the initial reports, and by 12:55 pm Eastern announced that a fix had been implemented and that the company's teams were monitoring the results.\n\n## Growing dependency on AI coding tools\n\nThe speed at which news of the outage spread shows how deeply embedded AI coding assistants have already become in modern software development. Claude Code, [announced](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/02/claude-3-7-sonnet-debuts-with-extended-thinking-to-tackle-complex-problems/) in February and [widely launched](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/anthropic-calls-new-claude-4-worlds-best-ai-coding-model/) in May, is Anthropic's terminal-based coding agent that can perform multi-step coding tasks across an existing code base.\n\nThe tool competes with OpenAI's [Codex](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/05/openai-introduces-codex-its-first-full-fledged-ai-agent-for-coding/) feature, a coding agent that generates production-ready code in isolated containers, Google's [Gemini CLI](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/06/google-is-bringing-vibe-coding-to-your-terminal-with-gemini-cli/), Microsoft's [GitHub Copilot](https://github.blog/ai-and-ml/github-copilot/under-the-hood-exploring-the-ai-models-powering-github-copilot/), which itself can use Claude models for code, and [Cursor](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/ai-coding-assistant-refuses-to-write-code-tells-user-to-learn-programming-instead/), a popular AI-powered IDE built on VS Code that also integrates multiple AI models, including Claude.\n\nDuring today's outage, some developers turned to alternative solutions. \"Z.AI works fine. Qwen works fine. Glad I switched,\" [posted](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45200368) one user on Hacker News. Others joked about reverting to older methods, with one suggesting the \"pseudo-LLM experience\" could be achieved with a [Python package](https://github.com/drathier/stack-overflow-import) that imports code directly from Stack Overflow.\n\nWhile AI coding assistants have accelerated development for some users, they've also caused problems for others who rely on them too heavily. The emerging practice of so-called \" [vibe coding](https://arstechnica.com/ai/2025/03/is-vibe-coding-with-ai-gnarly-or-reckless-maybe-some-of-both/)\"—using natural language to generate and execute code through AI models without fully understanding the underlying operations—has led to catastrophic failures.\n\nIn [recent incidents](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2025/07/ai-coding-assistants-chase-phantoms-destroy-real-user-data/), Google's Gemini CLI destroyed user files while attempting to reorganize them, and Replit's AI coding service deleted a production database despite explicit instructions not to modify code. These failures occurred when the AI models confabulated successful operations and built subsequent actions on false premises, highlighting the risks of depending on AI assistants that can misinterpret file structures or fabricate data to hide their errors.\n\nWednesday's outage served as a reminder that as dependency on AI grows, even minor service disruptions can become major events that affect an entire profession. But perhaps that could be a good thing if it's an excuse to take a break from a stressful workload. As one commenter [joked](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45200179), it might be \"time to go outside and touch some grass again.\"\n\n[![Photo of Benj Edwards](https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/benj_ega.png)](https://arstechnica.com/author/benjedwards/)\n\n[Benj Edwards](https://arstechnica.com/author/benjedwards/) Senior AI Reporter\n\n[Benj Edwards](https://arstechnica.com/author/benjedwards/) Senior AI Reporter\n\nBenj Edwards is Ars Technica's Senior AI Reporter and founder of the site's dedicated AI beat in 2022.
