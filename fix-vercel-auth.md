# Fix Vercel 401 Unauthorized Error

## The Problem
Your Vercel deployment is returning 401 Unauthorized, which means it's password-protected or requires authentication.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Check Vercel Dashboard Settings

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Click on your **signaldesk-frontend** project
3. Go to **Settings** tab
4. Look for **Password Protection** or **Authentication**
5. **DISABLE** any password protection
6. Save changes

### 2. Check Environment Protection

1. In Vercel Dashboard → Settings
2. Go to **Environment Variables**
3. Make sure there's no `VERCEL_PROTECT` or authentication variables
4. Check **Deployment Protection** settings
5. Set to "Public" or "None"

### 3. Alternative URLs to Try

The deployment might be available at:
- https://signaldesk-frontend.vercel.app
- https://signaldesk-frontend-nivra-sd.vercel.app
- Check Vercel dashboard for the actual production URL

### 4. If Password Protected

If you want to keep password protection but test:
1. Get the password from Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Password Protection
2. Visit the site and enter the password
3. Then the debugger will work

### 5. Deploy to New URL (Nuclear Option)

```bash
# Delete current project and redeploy
vercel rm signaldesk-frontend --yes

# Deploy as new project with different name
vercel --name signaldesk-media --prod

# This will give you a new URL without auth issues
```

### 6. Check Deployment Status

After fixing authentication:
1. Visit: https://signaldesk-frontend-23tc8mlwq-nivra-sd.vercel.app
2. You should see the React app (no 401 error)
3. Navigate to Media Intelligence
4. You should see "MEDIA INTELLIGENCE PLATFORM v2.0"

## Current Status

✅ Code is correct in GitHub
✅ MediaIntelligence component exists
✅ MediaListBuilder is removed
✅ Cache-busting headers added
❌ Vercel deployment is password-protected (401 error)

## Next Steps

1. **Remove password protection** in Vercel Dashboard
2. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for changes to propagate
3. **Test the site** - it should load without authentication
4. **Check Media Intelligence** - should show new component
