## Development Guide

### Current Component Status
The AISentimentMonitor component is currently using the original stable version without analytics integration. The component is fully functional with all features except the analytics tab.

### Analytics Integration (Future)
When ready to integrate analytics:
1. Use `MonitoringAnalytics` component (already created)
2. Add analytics button to tab navigation
3. Add analytics tab content section
4. Ensure proper JSX structure closure

Important Notes
Component Architecture

AISentimentMonitor.js is a large component (1300+ lines)
Consider refactoring into smaller sub-components for easier maintenance
Analytics integration requires careful JSX structure management

File Backups
Multiple backup versions exist in the Monitoring folder:

AISentimentMonitor_backup.js - Pre-analytics version
AISentimentMonitor_simple_analytics_working.js - Simplified test version
Various other backups from integration attempts

Best Practices

Always backup before major changes
Test component structure with simple versions first
Use version control (git) for better file management
Consider breaking large components into smaller pieces
