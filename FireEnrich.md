2. Network Mapping for Cascade Campaigns
Your Network Pattern needs exactly this:
javascript// Find paths to influence targets
const networkPath = await fireEnrich.mapInfluencePath({
  target: "Fortune 500 CEO",
  
  // Fire-Enrich reveals:
  connections: [
    "Board members they serve with",
    "University alumni network",
    "Conference co-speakers",
    "Twitter interactions",
    "LinkedIn endorsements"
  ],
  
  // SignalDesk calculates:
  optimal_path: "CEO -> Board member X -> Professor Y -> You"
})
3. Stakeholder Intelligence Enhancement
For your Power Broker persona:
javascriptconst stakeholderMap = {
  activist_investors: enrichProfile("Carl Icahn"),
  key_analysts: enrichProfile("Mary Meeker"),
  regulatory_connections: enrichProfile("SEC commissioners"),
  
  // Discover hidden connections:
  unexpected_influence: "CEO's spouse runs nonprofit with competitor's board member"
}
4. Crisis Response Intelligence
When crisis hits, instantly know:
javascriptconst crisisStakeholders = {
  reporters_covering: fireEnrich.bulk(reportersList),
  their_previous_coverage: "How did they cover similar crises?",
  their_sources: "Who do they quote regularly?",
  approach_vector: "Through which mutual connection?"
}
