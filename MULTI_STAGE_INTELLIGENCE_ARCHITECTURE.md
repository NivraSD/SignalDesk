# Multi-Stage Intelligence Architecture
## Quality Over Speed - 2-3 Minutes Total is Fine

### Core Philosophy
- **Each stage gets 30-60 seconds** to do deep, thorough work
- **Sequential processing** - each stage builds on the previous
- **No rushing** - better to be thorough than fast
- **Clear progress indicators** - user sees what's happening
- **Rich intermediate results** - each stage produces valuable insights

## Stage Architecture

### Stage 1: Organization Discovery & Competitor Analysis (45s)
**Purpose**: Deep understanding of the organization and competitive landscape

**Process**:
1. Analyze organization's business model, products, market position
2. Identify ALL competitors (not just top 3)
3. For each competitor:
   - Recent announcements
   - Product launches
   - Strategic moves
   - Leadership changes
   - Financial updates
4. Competitive positioning analysis
5. Competitive threats and opportunities

**Output**:
```javascript
{
  organization: {
    deep_profile: {...},
    strengths: [...],
    vulnerabilities: [...]
  },
  competitors: {
    direct: [
      {
        name: "Competitor A",
        recent_actions: [...],
        threat_level: "high",
        areas_of_conflict: [...],
        pr_implications: [...]
      }
    ],
    indirect: [...],
    emerging: [...]
  },
  competitive_landscape: {
    market_dynamics: {...},
    power_shifts: [...],
    narrative_battles: [...]
  }
}
```

### Stage 2: Media & Journalist Landscape (45s)
**Purpose**: Understand media coverage, sentiment, and journalist relationships

**Process**:
1. Scan major media outlets for industry coverage
2. Identify journalists covering the space
3. Analyze recent coverage of:
   - Your organization
   - Competitors
   - Industry topics
4. Sentiment analysis
5. Media opportunities and risks

**Output**:
```javascript
{
  media_landscape: {
    outlets: {
      tier1: [...],
      trade: [...],
      regional: [...]
    },
    journalists: [
      {
        name: "Jane Smith",
        outlet: "TechCrunch",
        recent_articles: [...],
        topics_of_interest: [...],
        sentiment_toward_industry: "positive"
      }
    ],
    coverage_analysis: {
      your_organization: {...},
      competitors: {...},
      gaps: [...]
    },
    opportunities: [
      {
        type: "narrative_vacuum",
        topic: "AI Safety",
        journalists_interested: [...],
        pr_angle: "..."
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Stage 3: Regulatory & Stakeholder Environment (45s)
**Purpose**: Map regulatory landscape and key stakeholder positions

**Process**:
1. Identify relevant regulators
2. Recent regulatory developments
3. Upcoming regulatory considerations
4. Analyst positions and reports
5. Activist concerns
6. Investor sentiment

**Output**:
```javascript
{
  regulatory: {
    bodies: [...],
    recent_developments: [...],
    upcoming_considerations: [...],
    compliance_risks: [...],
    pr_strategies: [...]
  },
  stakeholders: {
    analysts: {
      positions: [...],
      recent_reports: [...],
      concerns: [...]
    },
    investors: {
      sentiment: "...",
      key_concerns: [...],
      expectations: [...]
    },
    activists: {
      groups: [...],
      campaigns: [...],
      pressure_points: [...]
    }
  }
}
```

### Stage 4: Market Trends & Topic Analysis (30s)
**Purpose**: Identify trending topics and market dynamics

**Process**:
1. Scan for trending industry topics
2. Identify emerging themes
3. Track declining narratives
4. Spot conversation gaps
5. Analyze topic velocity and momentum

**Output**:
```javascript
{
  trending_topics: [
    {
      topic: "Quantum Computing",
      momentum: "accelerating",
      key_voices: [...],
      your_position: "not engaged",
      opportunity: "thought leadership"
    }
  ],
  narrative_shifts: [...],
  conversation_gaps: [...],
  pr_opportunities: [...]
}
```

### Stage 5: Pattern Recognition & Strategic Synthesis (45s)
**Purpose**: Connect all dots and identify non-obvious insights

**Process**:
1. Cross-reference all previous stages
2. Identify hidden connections
3. Spot cascade opportunities
4. Recognize defensive necessities
5. Generate strategic recommendations

**Output**:
```javascript
{
  patterns: [
    {
      type: "coordinated_competitive_move",
      evidence: [...],
      implication: "Industry preparing for major shift",
      pr_response: "Get ahead of narrative"
    }
  ],
  cascade_predictions: [
    {
      trigger: "If Competitor A announces...",
      likely_sequence: [...],
      optimal_response: {...}
    }
  ],
  strategic_recommendations: {
    immediate_24h: [...],
    this_week: [...],
    this_month: [...],
    defensive: [...],
    offensive: [...]
  },
  elite_insights: {
    hidden_connections: [...],
    asymmetric_opportunities: [...],
    narrative_leverage_points: [...],
    strategic_blindspots: [...]
  }
}
```

### Data Storage Strategy
- Each stage result is cached independently
- Can re-run individual stages without redoing everything
- Results accumulate into complete intelligence picture
- Cache for 24 hours (intelligence has shelf life)

### Why This Approach Works

1. **Thorough Analysis**: Each stage has time to be comprehensive
2. **Clear Progress**: User sees exactly what's happening
3. **Quality Insights**: No rushing means better pattern recognition
4. **Modular**: Can improve individual stages without breaking others
5. **Debuggable**: Can see exactly where issues occur
6. **Valuable Intermediate Results**: Even if later stages fail, early stages provide value

### User Experience
"Your deep intelligence analysis will take approximately 2-3 minutes. 
This thorough analysis examines your entire competitive landscape, 
media environment, regulatory considerations, and market dynamics 
to provide elite-level strategic insights that others miss."

### Key Differences from Current Approach
- **Sequential, not parallel** - each stage builds on previous
- **Longer timeouts** - 30-45s per stage vs rushing in 10s
- **Richer data per stage** - not just headlines but deep analysis
- **Clear separation** - no jumbled data
- **Progressive enhancement** - each stage adds value

## Next Steps
1. Build Stage 1 edge function with 45s timeout
2. Create progress UI component
3. Build stages 2-5 sequentially
4. Create new orchestrator that chains stages
5. Test with 2-3 minute full analysis time
