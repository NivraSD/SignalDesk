# Media List Display Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Media List Showing `[object Object]` in Chat
**Problem:** When NIV generated a media list, the backend was correctly formatting it as markdown in `response.message`, but the frontend was trying to display `response.content` (which is an object) directly.

**Fix Applied:** Updated `processResponse` in `NIVContentOrchestratorProduction.tsx` (line 1108-1111) to check content type:

```typescript
// For media-list, use the formatted message instead of raw content object
const displayContent = response.contentType === 'media-list'
  ? response.message
  : `**${response.contentType.replace('-', ' ').toUpperCase()}**\n\n${response.content}`
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ Deployed

### 2. Only 1 Journalist Displayed (Missing Gap-Filled Journalists)
**Problem:** When the journalist registry didn't have enough verified journalists:
- Backend found 1 verified journalist from database
- Backend called MCP to fill gaps with 14 additional sample journalists
- But only the 1 verified journalist was being formatted for display

**Root Cause:** The formatting code (line 1738-1754) only formatted `allJournalists` array (verified ones), but the gap-filled journalists were stored in `content.additional_journalists` as a string.

**Fix Applied:** Updated `niv-content-intelligent-v2/index.ts` (line 1756-1758) to append additional journalists:

```typescript
// Include additional journalists from web search if present
let displayMessage = `# Media List - ${focusArea}\n\n${content.note}\n\n${formattedList}`

if (content.additional_journalists) {
  displayMessage += `\n\n---\n\n${content.additional_journalists}`
}
```

**Result:** Now shows all 15 journalists (1 verified + 14 from web search) with a separator between verified and sample data.

**Status:** ‚úÖ Deployed

### 3. Missing Contact Information for Verified Journalists
**Problem:** Verified journalists from the database have real email addresses and Twitter handles, but they weren't being displayed. Only Twitter was shown, and emails were omitted.

**Database Evidence:**
```
Kevin Roose - New York Times
  Email: kevin.roose@nytimes.com
  Twitter: @kevinroose

Cade Metz - New York Times
  Email: cade.metz@nytimes.com
  Twitter: @CadeMetz
```

**Fix Applied:** Enhanced journalist formatting (line 1737-1754) to include all available contact information:

```typescript
// Format journalists for display with full contact info
const formattedList = allJournalists.map((j, i) => {
  const lines = [`${i + 1}. **${j.name}** - ${j.outlet}`];
  lines.push(`   ${j.title || 'Journalist'}`);
  lines.push(`   Focus: ${j.beat || j.coverage_area || focusArea}`);

  // Add contact information if available
  const contacts = [];
  if (j.email) contacts.push(`üìß ${j.email}`);
  if (j.twitter_handle || j.twitter) contacts.push(`üê¶ @${j.twitter_handle || j.twitter}`);
  if (j.linkedin_url) contacts.push(`üíº ${j.linkedin_url}`);

  if (contacts.length > 0) {
    lines.push(`   ${contacts.join(' ‚Ä¢ ')}`);
  }

  return lines.join('\n');
}).join('\n\n')
```

**New Format:**
```
1. **Kevin Roose** - New York Times
   Journalist
   Focus: Tech & AI
   üìß kevin.roose@nytimes.com ‚Ä¢ üê¶ @kevinroose
```

**Status:** ‚úÖ Deployed (134.2kB)

## Differences Between Verified and Sample Data

### Verified Journalists (from Database)
- **Source:** `journalist_registry` table in Supabase
- **Contact Info:** Real email addresses and Twitter handles
- **Quality:** Verified, up-to-date contact information
- **Display:** Formatted with full contact details including emails
- **Example:**
  ```
  1. **Cade Metz** - New York Times
     Journalist
     Focus: AI & Emerging Tech
     üìß cade.metz@nytimes.com ‚Ä¢ üê¶ @CadeMetz
  ```

### Sample Journalists (from Web Search)
- **Source:** MCP-generated via web search when gaps exist
- **Contact Info:** Marked as "SAMPLE DATA FOR PLANNING PURPOSES"
- **Quality:** Indicative/placeholder data for planning
- **Display:** Clearly labeled as sample with disclaimer
- **Example:**
  ```
