   - ‚úÖ But 4-6 weeks for $13k+/year ROI is worth it

2. ‚ùå "Gamma just works"
   - ‚úÖ True, but no integration = missed opportunity

3. ‚ùå "What if we don't maintain it?"
   - ‚úÖ Minimal maintenance needed (stable APIs)

4. ‚ùå "Gamma has more templates"
   - ‚úÖ But you can build PR-specific templates that are better

### 10. Migration Strategy

If you decide to build SignalDesk AI, here's how to transition:

#### Phase 1: Parallel Run (Months 1-2)
- Build SignalDesk AI system
- Keep using Gamma for production
- Test SignalDesk AI internally
- Compare quality side-by-side

#### Phase 2: Soft Launch (Month 3)
- Offer both options to users
- "Quick deck (Gamma)" vs "Intelligence deck (SignalDesk AI)"
- Collect feedback
- Iterate on templates

#### Phase 3: Full Migration (Month 4)
- Make SignalDesk AI default
- Keep Gamma as fallback
- Monitor cost savings
- Optimize performance

#### Phase 4: Optimization (Month 5+)
- Remove Gamma integration
- Build advanced features
- Create more templates
- Full NIV integration
