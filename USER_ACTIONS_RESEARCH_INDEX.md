### 2. Core Data Structure

```typescript
campaign.additionalTactics = Array<{
  type: string                // "executive-coffee", "analyst-briefing"
  who: string                 // "CEO / VP Sales"
  what: string               // Action description
  where: string              // "LinkedIn ‚Üí Direct message"
  when: string               // "Week 2, after thought leadership"
  estimatedEffort: string    // "1-2 hours (including prep)"
  resources?: string[]       // ["Talking points", "Case studies"]
}>
```

### 3. User Action Types (5 Categories)

| Category | % | Examples |
|----------|---|----------|
| Relationship Building | 30% | Direct outreach, value-first engagement, pitch delivery |
| Event Participation | 20% | Proposal submission, active participation, follow-up |
| Community Engagement | 25% | Thread participation, content sharing, community building |
| Direct Engagement | 15% | Executive outreach, analyst relations, partnerships |
| Content Distribution | 10% | Influencer content, exclusive sharing |

### 4. Frontend Presentation

User actions are displayed with:
- **Amber/Yellow color scheme** for visual distinction
- **Header:** "üë§ User Must Execute (N items)"
- **Card format** with WHO, WHERE, WHEN in grid layout
- **Description** showing what action to take
- **Effort estimate** showing time commitment

## Implementation for Opportunity Engine

### Step 1: Define Data Structure
- Create `opportunityActions` array similar to `additionalTactics`
- Include: type, who, what, where, when, estimatedEffort, priority, resources, successMetric

### Step 2: Create Generation Prompt
- Use Claude with Anthropic SDK (like Campaign Builder does)
- Analyze opportunity stage (Discovery ‚Üí Closing)
- Map to key stakeholders
- Recommend high-impact human interactions
- Include effort estimates

### Step 3: Build Frontend Component
- Use amber/yellow color scheme (proven in Campaign Builder)
- Display WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN in grid layout
- Show action type as badge
- Display effort estimate
- Link to supporting resources

### Step 4: Integrate with Workflow
- Show count in opportunity summary
- Group by phase/priority
- Enable filtering and sorting
- Track completion progress

### Step 5: Create Supporting Resources
- Email templates for outreach
- Talking points for calls
- Background research on contacts
- Meeting agenda templates

## Key Implementation Insights

1. **Visual Distinction is Critical**
   - Use amber/yellow consistently (proven effective)
   - Clear "User Must Execute" labeling prevents confusion with auto-execute actions

2. **Always Include WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN**
   - Minimal structure: these 4 + estimatedEffort
   - Users need to know exactly what to do and how long it takes

3. **Effort Estimates Matter**
   - Must show time commitment upfront
   - Include breakdown (prep + action + follow-up)
   - Helps with prioritization and scheduling

4. **Resources Enable Action**
   - Don't just recommend actions‚Äîprovide supporting materials
   - Email templates, talking points, contact research, background docs
   - Dramatically increases likelihood of execution

5. **Hierarchical Organization Works**
   - Group by stakeholder or phase
   - Show priority levels (1-4)
   - Enable filtering by effort/impact
   - Progressive disclosure (summary ‚Üí details)

6. **Progress Tracking Drives Engagement**
   - Allow users to mark actions as complete
   - Track metrics on effectiveness
   - Show feedback on impact
   - Build engagement loop
