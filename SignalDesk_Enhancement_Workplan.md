- Build momentum with beta users
- Identify actual priorities vs assumptions
- Risk: Minor bugs, incomplete features

**Wait Benefits:**
- More polished experience
- All components consistent
- Less user disruption
- Risk: Over-engineering, delayed feedback, lost momentum

### **RECOMMENDATION: DEPLOY NOW** ‚úÖ
