# SignalDesk Intelligence Objectives

## What We SHOULD Be Delivering (Not What We Currently Have)

### Executive PR Summary (Overview Tab)
**Purpose**: Synthesize insights across ALL dimensions for PR strategy
**Content**:
- How competitive moves affect our PR positioning
- Which stakeholder groups need immediate attention
- What trending topics we should leverage or defend against
- Predicted cascade effects and how to prepare PR responses
- **NOT just "here's what we found" but "here's what it means for PR"**

### Competition Tab
**Purpose**: Deep competitive intelligence for PR positioning
**Should Include**:
- What competitors are ACTUALLY doing (from news/web scraping)
- How their moves affect our narrative
- Opportunities to differentiate
- Threats to our reputation
- **Second Opinion**: Alternative view on competitive threats
- **NOT just a list of competitors**

### Stakeholders Tab  
**Purpose**: Stakeholder sentiment and engagement strategy
**Should Include**:
- ACTUAL sentiment from news/social (not generic)
- Specific concerns per stakeholder group
- Engagement priorities based on current events
- Messaging frameworks for each group
- **Second Opinion**: Alternative stakeholder prioritization
- **NOT just "investors, customers, employees" list**

### Topics & Trends Tab
**Purpose**: Media narrative and content opportunities
**Should Include**:
- What's ACTUALLY trending in our industry
- Narrative opportunities to leverage
- Risks in current media coverage
- Content angles to pursue
- **Second Opinion**: Alternative narrative strategies
- **NOT just empty arrays**

### Predictions Tab
**Purpose**: Forward-looking PR risk/opportunity analysis
**Should Include**:
- Likely scenarios based on current data
- Cascade effects (if X happens, then Y)
- Timeline of expected events
- Proactive PR strategies
- **Second Opinion**: Alternative future scenarios
- **NOT just "continue monitoring"**

## What Went Wrong

1. **Lost the Personas**: We had specialized personas (competitive strategist, stakeholder psychologist, risk prophet) providing deep analysis
2. **Lost Second Opinions**: The validation persona was providing valuable alternative perspectives
3. **Lost the Synthesis**: Instead of synthesizing insights, we're just passing through raw data
4. **Lost the Intelligence**: We're formatting empty data instead of generating insights

## What Was Working Before

- MCPs gathered real data (news, websites, Reddit)
- Multiple personas analyzed from different angles
- Second opinions provided depth
- Synthesis created actual PR intelligence
- Display showed rich, dynamic content

## The Fix We Need

1. **Ensure MCPs are returning data** (not empty arrays)
2. **Ensure synthesis is happening** (not just passing through)
3. **Ensure personas are analyzing** (not just formatting)
4. **Ensure display shows insights** (not just structure)
