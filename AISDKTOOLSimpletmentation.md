# AI SDK Tools Implementation Consideration

## Overview
This document outlines the potential implementation of AI SDK Tools for SignalDesk V3 to enhance AI interactions across the platform.

## Why AI SDK Tools?

The AI SDK from Vercel provides several advantages for AI-powered applications:

1. **Streaming Responses**: Better UX with real-time streaming of AI responses
2. **Tool Calling**: Structured function calling with type safety
3. **Structured Outputs**: Type-safe responses with Zod schemas
4. **Multi-Provider Support**: Easy switching between AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
5. **React Hooks**: Built-in hooks for seamless React integration
6. **Error Handling**: Robust error handling and retry logic

## Potential Implementation Areas

### 1. Intelligence Pipeline Enhancement
- Stream synthesis results as they're generated
- Show real-time progress within each stage
- Better error recovery and partial results

### 2. Opportunity Detection
- Stream opportunities as they're identified
- Progressive enhancement with creative fields
- Real-time scoring updates

### 3. Content Generation
- Stream content generation (press releases, social posts)
- Show writing progress with partial results
- Allow for mid-generation adjustments

### 4. Interactive Chat Interface
- Add conversational AI for strategy discussion
- Context-aware responses based on current intelligence
- Tool calling for executing PR actions directly

## Implementation Example

```typescript
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { streamText, tool } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

// Define tools with Zod schemas
const generatePressRelease = tool({
  description: 'Generate a press release',
  parameters: z.object({
    topic: z.string(),
    tone: z.enum(['formal', 'casual', 'urgent']),
    length: z.number().min(100).max(1000),
  }),
  execute: async ({ topic, tone, length }) => {
    // Implementation here
  },
});

// Stream responses with tool calling
const result = await streamText({
  model: openai('gpt-4-turbo'),
  messages: conversation,
  tools: {
    generatePressRelease,
    // ... other tools
  },
});
```

## Benefits for SignalDesk V3

1. **Better User Experience**
   - Reduced perceived latency with streaming
   - More interactive and responsive UI
   - Progressive enhancement of results

2. **Developer Experience**
   - Type-safe tool definitions
   - Consistent error handling
   - Easier testing and debugging

3. **Scalability**
   - Efficient token usage with streaming
   - Better resource management
   - Support for multiple AI providers

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: Research & Planning (1 week)
- Evaluate current AI interactions
- Identify high-impact areas for improvement
- Create detailed implementation plan

### Phase 2: Core Integration (2 weeks)
- Integrate AI SDK into existing services
- Update Edge Functions to support streaming
- Implement basic tool calling

### Phase 3: UI Enhancement (1 week)
- Add streaming UI components
- Implement progress indicators
- Create interactive chat interface

### Phase 4: Testing & Optimization (1 week)
- Performance testing
- Error handling improvements
- User acceptance testing

## Considerations

1. **Compatibility**: Ensure compatibility with existing Supabase Edge Functions
2. **Cost**: Evaluate potential impact on API costs with streaming
3. **Complexity**: Balance added functionality with maintainability
4. **Migration**: Plan for gradual migration of existing AI calls

## Next Steps

1. Review this proposal with the team
2. Create proof of concept for one module
3. Measure performance improvements
4. Make go/no-go decision based on results
