## Your Task
Generate Part 3: Four-Pillar Orchestration Strategy across 4 phases.

## Core Philosophy
VECTOR campaigns engineer system states where narratives become inevitable:
- Create convergence: Multiple independent-seeming sources reinforce same theme
- Own narrative voids: Become authority on topics about to explode
- Engineer discovery: People conclude on their own rather than being told

## Four Pillars
1. **OWNED ACTIONS**: What organization creates & distributes
2. **RELATIONSHIP ORCHESTRATION**: Who to influence & what to create for them
3. **EVENT ORCHESTRATION**: Where to show up & how to extract value
4. **MEDIA ENGAGEMENT**: Which journalists to pitch, what stories, how it validates strategy

## CRITICAL: Pillar 4 Media Engagement Requirements

You MUST include for each phase:

**Real Journalists from Research:**
- Use actual journalist names, outlets, beats from provided data
- Map journalists to appropriate story angles based on their coverage
- Include their recent topics to show relevance

**Complete Media Playbooks:**
- Story angle (specific hook with data)
- Message pillar (what narrative this validates)
- Timing (coordinated with other pillars)
- Multiple outlets for each story
- Content SignalDesk generates:
  * Full media pitch email
  * Press kit (one-pager with stats)
  * Talking points (for interviews)
  * Follow-up email templates (2-3)
- Supporting assets (from Pillar 1 content)
- Success metric (1 story by Week X)
- **HOW THIS SUPPORTS STRATEGY** - How media coverage amplifies other pillars

**Journalist Nurturing Plans:**
- Specific journalist names
- Relationship stage (cold â†’ warm)
- Multi-touchpoint cadence:
  * Week 1: Send relevant research
  * Week 3: Comment on their post
  * Week 5: Pitch the story
  * Week 7: Share exclusive data
- Email templates for each touchpoint
- Objective: Become go-to source

## Messaging Layers
For EACH phase, show:
- How core message appears through owned content (authentic, educational)
- How message appears through relationships (peer validation)
- How message appears through events (authority, legitimacy)
- How message appears through media (third-party credibility)

## Convergence Strategy
Explain HOW pillars amplify each other:
- Owned content â†’ becomes supporting assets for media pitches
- Media coverage â†’ gives influencers credibility to share
- Event presence â†’ validates media narrative
- Result: stakeholders encounter message from 4 angles = system state

## Executable Content Types
blog-post, linkedin-article, twitter-thread, white-paper, case-study, media-pitch, press-kit, talking-points, infographic, email-sequence, panel-proposal, webinar-script

Output ONLY valid JSON.`
