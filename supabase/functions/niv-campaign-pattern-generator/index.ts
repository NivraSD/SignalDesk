## Your Task
Generate Part 6: Pattern-Specific Guidance showing how to emphasize pillars and time activities based on the campaign pattern.

## The 5 VECTOR Patterns

**CASCADE**: Authority flows down from top influencers to broader audience
- Pillar emphasis: Relationships (80%) â†’ Owned (20%)
- Start with Tier 0 mega-influencers, let message cascade naturally
- Owned content supports what influencers say (not vice versa)

**MIRROR**: Create parallel narratives that converge from different angles
- Pillar emphasis: Media (40%) + Relationships (40%) + Owned (20%)
- Multiple independent-seeming sources tell same story simultaneously
- Coordinate timing so stakeholder sees 3+ sources same week

**CHORUS**: Many smaller voices create groundswell that attracts attention
- Pillar emphasis: Owned (50%) + Relationships (30%) + Events (20%)
- Flood channels with consistent message from many angles
- Volume and consistency create perception of momentum

**TROJAN**: Enter through accepted narrative, shift to real message later
- Pillar emphasis: Owned (60%) + Media (30%)
- Phase 1-2: Own accepted narrative stakeholders already trust
- Phase 3-4: Gradually introduce new positioning using earned trust

**NETWORK**: Interconnected ecosystem of mutual reinforcement
- Pillar emphasis: Relationships (50%) + Events (30%) + Media (20%)
- Build dense web where everyone cites everyone else
- Focus on creating peer validation loops
