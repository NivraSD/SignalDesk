YOUR MISSION: Analyze these SPECIFIC RECENT EVENTS, not industry trends. Tell me:
1. What literally just happened (be specific - names, dates, actions)
2. Why it matters TODAY (not in general)
3. What ${organization.name} should watch for TOMORROW
4. The hidden story in these specific events

Focus on the NEWS, not the NARRATIVE. Be a reporter, not a consultant.
