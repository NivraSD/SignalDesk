# Campaign Builder User Actions Implementation Analysis

## Overview
Campaign Builder implements a sophisticated two-layer action system:
1. **Signaldesk Auto-Execute Actions** - Automatically generated and executed by the system
2. **User Must Execute Actions** (additionalTactics) - Recommendations that require manual user execution

This document details how user actions are generated, structured, and presented.

## 1. WHERE USER ACTIONS ARE GENERATED

### Generation Pipeline

#### 1.1 Data Flow
```
Campaign Builder Wizard (Frontend)
    ‚Üì
/api/generate-blueprint (Proxy Route)
    ‚Üì
niv-campaign-blueprint-orchestrator (Supabase Edge Function)
    ‚îú‚îÄ STEP 1: niv-campaign-blueprint-base
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Generates: Overview, Goal Framework, Stakeholder Mapping, Message Architecture
    ‚îú‚îÄ STEP 2: niv-blueprint-stakeholder-orchestration (async in database)
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ Generates: Stakeholder Orchestration Plans with campaign tactics
    ‚îî‚îÄ STEP 3: niv-campaign-execution-generator
        ‚îî‚îÄ Generates: Execution Requirements (team, budget, resources)

/api/finalize-blueprint (Proxy Route)
    ‚Üì
niv-campaign-blueprint-finalize (Supabase Edge Function)
    ‚îî‚îÄ Fetches orchestration from database & merges all parts
```

#### 1.2 Key Edge Functions Responsible for User Actions

**niv-campaign-orchestration-generator** - PRIMARY GENERATOR
- Location: `/supabase/functions/niv-campaign-orchestration-generator/index.ts`
- Responsible for generating Part 3: Four-Pillar Orchestration Strategy
- Creates ALL user actions within the "additionalTactics" field

**niv-campaign-execution-generator** - SECONDARY ENRICHMENT
- Location: `/supabase/functions/niv-campaign-execution-generator/index.ts`
- Enriches user actions with execution requirements (effort, resources)
- Generates Part 5: Execution Requirements

## 2. HOW USER ACTIONS ARE STRUCTURED

### 2.1 Data Structure (TypeScript Interface)

From `BlueprintV3Presentation.tsx`:

```typescript

        socialPosts?: Array<{...}>       // Auto-execute
        thoughtLeadership?: Array<{...}> // Auto-execute
        additionalTactics?: Array<{      // USER ACTIONS ‚Üê THIS IS IT
          type?: string                   // E.g., "partnership", "direct-outreach"
          who?: string                    // Person/role executing
          what?: string                   // Action description
          where?: string                  // Channel/location
          when?: string                   // Timing
          estimatedEffort?: string        // "2-3 hours"
          resources?: string[]            // Required tools/materials
        }>
      }
      completionCriteria?: string[]

## 3. TYPES OF USER ACTIONS RECOMMENDED

### 3.1 Action Categories (from orchestration generator)

The system generates user actions across multiple categories:

#### **Pillar 1: Owned Actions - User Execution**
- **Community Engagement**: Comment on relevant Reddit/HN threads
- **Distribution**: Share content in target communities
- **Platform Management**: Respond to comments, engage in discussions

```typescript
distributionStrategy: {
  engagementChannels: [
    {
      platform: "Reddit r/[Topic]",
      engagementType: "Comment on threads",
      cadence: "3-5/week",
      tone: "Helpful peer",
      signaldeskGenerates: "10 comment templates"
      // USER MUST: Actually post the comments and engage
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **Pillar 2: Relationship Orchestration - USER REQUIRED**
These are fundamentally human activities that require personal touch:

```typescript
tier1Influencers: [
  {
    stakeholderSegment: "Decision makers in target market",
    exampleTargets: [
      {
        name: "John Smith",
        userAction: "LinkedIn message with personalized intro"
      }
    ],
    contentToCreateForThem: [
      {
        contentType: "white-paper",
        signaldeskGenerates: "White paper with citations",
        userExecutes: "Send via LinkedIn with personalized note",  // ‚Üê USER ACTION
        timing: "Week 1"
      }
    ],
    touchpointCadence: [
      "Week 1: Send relevant research with no ask",
      "Week 3: Comment value-add on their LinkedIn post",
      "Week 5: Pitch the data story with exclusive angle",
      "Week 7: Share early survey results before public"
    ]
  }
]
```

**User Actions in this Pillar:**
- Direct LinkedIn/email outreach to influencers
- Personalized note writing (can use templates)
- Value-first engagement (sharing research without asking for anything)
- Relationship nurturing (30-60 day cadence)
- Pitch delivery for specific asks

#### **Pillar 3: Event Orchestration - USER REQUIRED**
All event activities require human execution:

```typescript
tier1Events: [
  {
    event: "TechCrunch Disrupt 2024",
    date: "September 2024",
    presenceStrategy: {
      officialParticipation: "Panel proposal",  // ‚Üê USER ACTION: Apply for panel
      socialStrategy: "Live-tweet sessions"     // ‚Üê USER ACTION: Attend and live-tweet
    }
  }
]
```

**User Actions in this Pillar:**
- Submit speaker/panel proposals
- Attend events in person or virtually
- Actively participate in discussions
- Network with attendees
- Live-tweet key sessions
- Follow up with contacts met at events

#### **Pillar 4: Media Engagement - HYBRID (Some Auto)**
Some are auto-executed, some require user follow-up:

```typescript
journalistNurturing: [
  {
    journalist: "Jane Reporter",
    outlet: "TechNews Daily",
    relationshipStage: "Cold ‚Üí Warm",
    touchpoints: [
      "Week 1: Send relevant research with no ask",
      // SignalDesk generates the email ‚Üì
      "Week 3: Comment value-add on their LinkedIn post",
      // USER ACTION: Actually go comment on their post ‚Üì
      "Week 5: Pitch the data story with exclusive angle",
      // USER ACTION: Send personalized pitch email ‚Üì
      "Week 7: Share early survey results before public"
      // USER ACTION: Share exclusive data ‚Üì
    ]
  }
]
```

**User Actions in this Pillar:**
- Personalized pitch delivery (despite template)
- LinkedIn engagement on journalist's posts
- Exclusive data sharing
- Interview scheduling and execution
- Follow-up and relationship maintenance

## 5. HOW USER ACTIONS FIT IN THE BLUEPRINT WORKFLOW

### Execution Inventory Section (BlueprintV3Presentation.tsx, lines 991-1164)

The "Execution Inventory" section shows:

```
Priority 1: Launch Critical
‚îú‚îÄ Stakeholder 1
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Media Pitches: 3 items (Signaldesk Auto-Execute)
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Social Posts: 8 items (Signaldesk Auto-Execute)
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Thought Leadership: 2 items (Signaldesk Auto-Execute)
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ User Actions: 5 items (üë§ User Must Execute) ‚Üê YOUR FOCUS
‚îú‚îÄ Stakeholder 2
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Media Pitches: 2 items
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Social Posts: 5 items
‚îÇ  ‚îú‚îÄ Thought Leadership: 1 item
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ User Actions: 3 items
...
```

This provides a **content summary** view before users drill down into details.

## 6. IMPLEMENTATION FOR OPPORTUNITY ENGINE

### Recommended Approach

#### Step 1: Create Similar Data Structure
```typescript
// In your Opportunity intelligence schema
opportunityOrchestration: {
  opportunityActions?: Array<{
    type: string           // "partnership", "outreach", "event", etc.
    who: string           // Person/role executing
    what: string          // Action description
    where: string         // Channel (LinkedIn, email, in-person)
    when: string          // Timing relative to opportunity
    estimatedEffort: string // "2-3 hours"
    priority: number      // 1-4 based on impact
    resources: string[]   // Required materials
    successMetric: string // How to measure completion
  }>
}
```

#### Step 2: Generation Strategy
```
Generate opportunity actions by:
1. Analyzing opportunity stage (Discovery ‚Üí Negotiation ‚Üí Closing)
2. Mapping to key stakeholders for that opportunity
3. Recommending human interactions that move the deal forward
4. Distinguishing from auto-execute system actions
5. Providing effort estimates and resource requirements
```

#### Step 3: Frontend Display (Recommended)
```typescript
// Similar to Campaign Builder's "User Must Execute" section
// Show amber/yellow cards for user actions with:
// - Clear action type badge
// - WHO (role executing)
// - WHERE (channel)
// - WHEN (timing)
// - WHAT (description)
// - Estimated effort and resources
// - Success metric
```

#### Step 4: Integration with Workflow
```
1. In Opportunity Summary: Show count of user actions
2. In Execution Planning: Break down by phase/stage
3. In Opportunity Progress: Track completion of user actions
4. In Recommendations: Suggest next user action based on current stage
```

---

## 7. KEY INSIGHTS FOR IMPLEMENTATION

### Critical Success Factors

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
   - Explicitly mark what's auto vs. user-executed
   - Use consistent visual language (amber/yellow for user actions)
   - Show effort estimates upfront

2. **Actionable Recommendations**
   - Every user action should have clear WHO, WHAT, WHERE, WHEN
   - Provide templates/scripts for standard actions
   - Include success criteria

3. **Hierarchical Organization**
   - Group actions by stakeholder/phase
   - Show priority levels
   - Enable filtering by effort/impact

4. **Progress Tracking**
   - Allow users to mark actions as complete
   - Track engagement metrics
   - Provide feedback on effectiveness

5. **Resource Support**
   - Generate email templates for outreach
   - Create talking points for calls
   - Provide background research for each contact

## Summary

Campaign Builder's user actions system:
1. **Generates** through specialized orchestration edge functions
2. **Structures** data with type, effort, timing, and resource fields
3. **Presents** with clear visual distinction (amber "User Must Execute" cards)
4. **Organizes** by stakeholder priority and campaign phase
5. **Integrates** with auto-execute content to create multi-channel campaigns

The same pattern can be adapted for Opportunity Engine to recommend strategic human actions that complement automated system activities.
