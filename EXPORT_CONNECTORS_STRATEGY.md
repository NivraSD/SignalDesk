# SignalDesk V3 Export Connectors Strategy
## Enabling User-Controlled Content Distribution

*Created: November 2024*

---

## Executive Summary

SignalDesk V3 will implement an **export-only distribution model** that allows users to connect their own services and control content distribution. This approach maintains compliance, reduces liability, and gives users flexibility to work with their existing tools.

**Core Philosophy**: SignalDesk generates → Users distribute through their own accounts

---

## 🎯 Strategic Objectives

1. **Zero Direct Posting** - No content sent directly from SignalDesk platform
2. **User Account Control** - Users connect and manage their own service credentials
3. **Audit Trail** - Complete tracking of what was exported when
4. **Enterprise Compliance** - IT departments maintain control over corporate accounts
5. **Tool Flexibility** - Work with whatever tools the organization already uses

## 📤 Direct Export from Content Generation Points

### Export Locations in SignalDesk

#### 1. **Content Generator (NIVContentOrchestrator)**
After content is generated, users can immediately:
```
[Content Generated]
       ↓
✅ Save to Library | 📤 Export to: [Google Docs] [Office 365] [Dropbox] [Box]
```

#### 2. **Memory Vault**
For saved strategies and content:
```
[Saved Strategies/Content]
       ↓
📂 Open in: [Google Docs] [Word] | 💾 Save to: [Dropbox] [Box] [OneDrive]
```

#### 3. **Content Workspace**
While editing content:
```
[Editing Content]
       ↓
🔄 Continue editing in: [Google Docs] [Word] | 📤 Share via: [Gmail] [Outlook]
```

### Supported Export Destinations

**Document Editing:**
- Google Docs
- Microsoft Word (Office 365)
- Apple Pages

**Cloud Storage:**
- Google Drive
- Dropbox
- Box
- OneDrive
- SharePoint

- .pdf (PDF)
- .md (Markdown)
- .html (HTML)
- .txt (Plain Text)

## 📧 Email Draft Creation (Game Changer)

### Concept
Instead of sending emails, create **drafts in user's email client** for review and sending.

### Workflow
```
1. SignalDesk generates pitch/email content
2. User selects "Create Draft in: [Gmail/Outlook]"
3. Draft appears in user's Drafts folder
4. User reviews, personalizes, and sends when ready
```

### Key Benefits
- **Personalization** - Users can add personal touches before sending
- **Native Features** - Uses their email signatures, tracking pixels, etc.
- **Contact Access** - Leverages their existing address book
- **Legal Protection** - Nothing sent without explicit user action
- **Scheduling** - Users can schedule sends through their email client

### Implementation Example - Gmail
```javascript
async function createGmailDraft(emailContent) {
  const draft = {
    message: {
      to: emailContent.recipient,
      subject: emailContent.subject,
      body: emailContent.body,
      cc: emailContent.cc || '',
      attachments: emailContent.attachments || []
    }
  }

  // Creates draft without sending
  const response = await gmailAPI.users.drafts.create({
    userId: 'me',
    resource: draft
  })

  // User can now open and send from Gmail
  return response.data.id
}
```

### Use Cases

**Media Pitches:**
- Generate personalized pitches for journalist list
- Create 20+ draft emails in user's Gmail
- User reviews each and sends individually

**Executive Communications:**
- Board updates as drafts for CEO review
- Investor letters with attachments ready to send
- All-hands messages pre-loaded for scheduling

**Crisis Response:**
- Pre-drafted statements for legal review
- Stakeholder updates ready to customize
- Media responses with approved messaging

---

## 🔧 Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Basic Export (Week 1-2)
**Objective**: Enable document export and downloads

**Deliverables:**
- Download buttons for all content types
- Basic file format conversions (.docx, .pdf, .txt)
- Google Docs one-click open
- Microsoft Word one-click open

**Implementation:**
```javascript
// Simple export button component
<ExportButton
  content={generatedContent}
  options={['download', 'google-docs', 'word']}
/>
```

### Phase 2: Cloud Storage Integration (Week 3-4)
**Objective**: Direct save to cloud storage

**Deliverables:**
- Google Drive integration via Picker API
- Dropbox integration via Saver API
- OneDrive integration via File Picker
- Box integration via Content Picker

**Key APIs:**
- Google Picker API (easiest)
- Dropbox Chooser/Saver
- Microsoft OneDrive File Picker
- Box Content Picker

### Phase 3: Email Draft Creation (Week 5-6)
**Objective**: Create email drafts in user accounts

**Deliverables:**
- Gmail draft creation via Gmail API
- Outlook draft creation via Microsoft Graph
- Bulk draft creation for media lists
- Template preservation in drafts

**Authentication:**
- OAuth 2.0 for Gmail
- OAuth 2.0 for Office 365
- User consent for draft creation only

---

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Authentication Flow
```
User Settings
    ↓
"Connect Services"
    ↓
OAuth to Gmail/Outlook/Google Drive/etc
    ↓
Tokens stored securely (encrypted)
    ↓
Available for export operations
```

### Security Considerations
- **Token Storage**: Encrypted in database
- **Scope Limitation**: Only request necessary permissions
- **Token Refresh**: Automatic refresh for expired tokens
- **Revocation**: Users can disconnect services anytime
- **Audit Log**: Track all export operations

### API Requirements

**Google Workspace:**
- Gmail API (drafts.create scope)
- Drive API (file.create scope)
- Docs API (document.create scope)

**Microsoft 365:**
- Microsoft Graph API
- Mail.ReadWrite (for drafts)
- Files.ReadWrite (for OneDrive)

**Storage Providers:**
- Dropbox API v2
- Box API 2.0
- Standard OAuth 2.0 flows
