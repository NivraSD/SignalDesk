# Opportunity Engine Quick Start Guide

## âœ… What We've Built

### 1. **MCP Architecture** (11 Total MCPs)
- 9 SignalDesk MCPs (memory, campaigns, media, opportunities, monitor, intelligence, relationships, analytics, content)
- 1 Playwright MCP (browser automation)
- 1 SignalDesk Scraper MCP (custom web monitoring)

### 2. **Integration Documents**
- `OPPORTUNITY_ENGINE_MCP_INTEGRATION.md` - Complete integration strategy
- `signaldesk-scraper` - Playwright-powered web scraping MCP

### 3. **Key Components Created**
- Signal detection pipeline design
- Cascade intelligence system blueprint
- Pattern matching framework
- MCP orchestration strategy

## ðŸš€ Quick Start Steps

### Step 1: Build & Install the Scraper MCP
```bash
cd mcp-servers/signaldesk-scraper
npm install
npm run build
```

### Step 2: Set Up Database Tables
```bash
# Run the setup SQL to create necessary tables
PGPASSWORD=MUmjKBxTiecMPpYVgwGsZEKyFfyFbxqV psql \
  -h aws-0-us-west-1.pooler.supabase.com \
  -p 6543 \
  -U postgres.zskaxjtyuaqazydouifp \
  -d postgres \
  -f setup.sql
```

### Step 3: Deploy MCP Bridge Edge Function
```bash
cd frontend
supabase functions deploy mcp-bridge
```

### Step 4: Restart Claude Desktop
All 11 MCPs are now configured and ready to use!

## ðŸŽ¯ Testing the Integration

### Test 1: Basic Web Scraping
With Claude Desktop, try:
```
"Use the signaldesk-scraper to monitor TechCrunch for competitor mentions"
```

### Test 2: Cascade Detection
```
"Check for cascade indicators related to supply chain disruptions"
```

### Test 3: Pattern Matching
```
"Analyze recent news for competitor weakness patterns"
```

## ðŸ“Š Next Implementation Phases

### Phase 1 (Week 1-2): Foundation
- [x] Install Playwright MCP
- [x] Create scraper MCP
- [ ] Test basic signal collection
- [ ] Verify database connectivity

### Phase 2 (Week 3-4): Integration
- [ ] Connect scraper to Opportunity Engine
- [ ] Implement pattern matching in production
- [ ] Test cascade detection
- [ ] Set up monitoring schedules

### Phase 3 (Week 5-6): Automation
- [ ] Enable continuous monitoring
- [ ] Configure smart alerts
- [ ] Test brief generation
- [ ] Train pattern recognition

### Phase 4 (Week 7-8): Optimization
- [ ] Analyze first results
- [ ] Tune confidence thresholds
- [ ] Expand monitoring sources
- [ ] Deploy to full production

## ðŸ”§ Customization Points

### 1. Add New Patterns
Edit `opportunity_patterns` table or update patterns in:
```javascript
// signaldesk-scraper/src/index.ts
const OPPORTUNITY_PATTERNS = {
  yourNewPattern: {
    indicators: ['keyword1', 'keyword2'],
    confidence: 0.7
  }
}
```

### 2. Adjust Monitoring Frequency
```javascript
// In your monitoring setup
monitor_changes('competitor-url', 'hourly') // or 'daily', 'weekly'
```

### 3. Customize Cascade Detection
Add industry-specific cascade indicators:
```javascript
detect_cascades([
  'your industry term',
  'specific disruption type',
  'regulatory keyword'
])
```

## ðŸš¨ Testing Cascade Detection

Try this scenario to see cascade intelligence in action:

1. **Primary Event**: "Major cloud provider outage"
2. **First-Order Effects**: 
   - Your competitor's service is down
   - Customers seeking alternatives
3. **Second-Order Effects**:
   - Industry questioning cloud reliability
   - Regulatory scrutiny increasing
4. **Your Opportunity**:
   - Immediate: Announce your multi-cloud architecture
   - Near-term: Thought leadership on resilience
   - Long-term: Shape regulatory narrative

## ðŸ“ˆ Success Metrics to Track

1. **Detection Rate**: Valid opportunities found per day
2. **Action Rate**: % of opportunities acted upon
3. **Time to Detection**: Average time from signal to alert
4. **Cascade Accuracy**: % of correctly predicted effects
5. **ROI**: Media coverage generated per opportunity

## ðŸ†˜ Troubleshooting

### MCPs Not Loading
```bash
# Restart Claude Desktop after config changes
# Check logs: ~/Library/Logs/Claude/
```

### Scraper Not Working
```bash
# Test Playwright installation
cd mcp-servers/signaldesk-scraper
npm test
```

### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Test connection
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1"
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Your Unique Advantages

1. **Cascade Intelligence** - No other PR platform has this
2. **11 Specialized MCPs** - Deep, multi-source enrichment
3. **Pattern Learning** - Gets smarter over time
4. **Pre-Generated Assets** - Ready when opportunity strikes
5. **Playwright Monitoring** - Beyond RSS to deep web intel

## Ready to Start?
