# üö® CRITICAL: Your Vercel Deployment is Password Protected

## The Problem
Your Vercel deployment is returning **401 Unauthorized**. This means:
- The deployment is behind password protection
- OR your Vercel account has authentication enabled for all projects

## Immediate Fix Required

### Option 1: Remove Password Protection (Recommended)

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard**
   - https://vercel.com/dashboard
   
2. **Find Your Project**
   - Look for `signaldesk-frontend` or `signaldesk-new`
   
3. **Go to Settings ‚Üí General**
   - Scroll down to **Password Protection**
   - Toggle it **OFF**
   - Save changes

4. **Check Deployment Protection**
   - Settings ‚Üí Deployment Protection
   - Set to **"None"** or **"Public"**

### Option 2: Get the Password

If you need to keep it protected:
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Password Protection
2. Copy the password
3. Visit: https://signaldesk-498134tnw-nivra-sd.vercel.app
4. Enter the password
5. Then Media Intelligence will work

### Option 3: Deploy Publicly (Nuclear Option)

```bash
# Create completely new deployment
cd /Users/jonathanliebowitz/Desktop/SignalDesk

# Remove Vercel config
rm -rf .vercel

# Deploy with public access
vercel --public --prod

# Follow prompts, create new project
```

## What's Actually Deployed

Your code is correct and deployed:
- ‚úÖ MediaIntelligence component exists
- ‚úÖ MediaListBuilder is removed
- ‚úÖ Routing is correct
- ‚ùå BUT: Site requires authentication to access

## Test After Fixing

Once you remove password protection:

1. Visit the deployment URL
2. Go to any project
3. Click "Media Intelligence" 
4. You should see "MEDIA INTELLIGENCE PLATFORM v2.0"

## Your Deployment URLs

Try these after removing password:
- https://signaldesk-498134tnw-nivra-sd.vercel.app
- https://signaldesk-new.vercel.app
- https://signaldesk-frontend-23tc8mlwq-nivra-sd.vercel.app

**The code is deployed correctly. You just need to remove the password protection in Vercel settings!**
