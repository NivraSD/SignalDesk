I'm thinking of it as an AI Co-Pilot that's deeply integrated into each feature, not floating above it. Here's how we could architect this:

Core Architecture

1. Unified AI Co-Pilot Interface
   [Feature Workspace - 70%] | [AI Co-Pilot Panel - 30%]

- Live feature content | - Conversation thread
- Real-time updates | - Attached documents
- Change indicators | - Version history
  | - Action buttons

2. Key Interaction Patterns
   Direct Manipulation

User: "Make the first paragraph more impactful"
AI: Updates the content directly "I've strengthened the opening with concrete metrics and a bolder claim. The changes are highlighted in blue."

Cross-Feature Context

User: Drags in last month's campaign report
User: "Apply the same strategic framework but for our new product"
AI: Restructures current report "I've adapted the Q3 framework, focusing on the same KPIs but updating for your SaaS product launch."

Iterative Refinement

User: "The competitive analysis feels weak"
AI: "I'll expand it. What specific competitors should I focus on?"
User: "Focus on TechCorp and StartupX"
AI: Expands section with detailed analysis "I've added market share data, feature comparisons, and strategic positioning for both competitors."

3. Feature-Specific Behaviors

4. Smart Features

"Your last campaign targeted millennials. Should I adjust the media list?"

Proactive Suggestions

"Based on your campaign goals, you might want to add an influencer strategy section"
"I found 3 relevant case studies in your MemoryVault that could strengthen this"

Learning from Edits

AI learns your preferences
Suggests based on past refinements
Remembers your brand voice

5. Technical Implementation
   The Co-Pilot would need to:

Maintain full feature state
Track all changes with attribution
Handle async updates smoothly
Support undo/redo for AI changes
Stream responses for real-time feel
