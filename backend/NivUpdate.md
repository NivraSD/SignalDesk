Building Niv as a Strategic PR Assistant

1. CORE ARCHITECTURE: Yes, RAG is Critical
   RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) would be perfect here:
   Niv's Knowledge Base (RAG Components):
   â”œâ”€â”€ PR Best Practices Database
   â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Crisis playbooks
   â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Campaign templates  
   â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Media pitch frameworks
   â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Industry benchmarks
   â”œâ”€â”€ Historical Context
   â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Past campaigns (via signaldesk-memory)
   â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ Journalist interactions (signaldesk-relationships)
   â”‚ â””â”€â”€ Success/failure patterns
   â””â”€â”€ Real-Time Intelligence
   â”œâ”€â”€ Market signals (signaldesk-intelligence)
   â”œâ”€â”€ Competitor moves (signaldesk-scraper)
   â””â”€â”€ Media narratives (signaldesk-monitor)
2. NIV'S STRATEGIC BRAIN: Layered Prompt Architecture
   python# Niv's Core Identity Prompt
   NIV_IDENTITY = """

   """

# Strategic Decision Framework

NIV_STRATEGIC_FRAMEWORK = """
For EVERY user query, follow this framework:

1.  SITUATIONAL AWARENESS

    - What's the real challenge behind the question?
    - What's the competitive landscape?
    - What are the cascade risks?

2.  STRATEGIC OPTIONS

    - Never give just tactics
    - Always provide 3 strategic paths
    - Include risk/reward analysis

3.  EXECUTION ROADMAP

    - Specific, sequenced actions
    - Resource requirements
    - Success metrics

4.  PROACTIVE GUIDANCE
    - What they haven't asked but should
    - Next moves after this one
    - Long-term implications
      """
5.  INTELLIGENT MCP ORCHESTRATION
    Instead of random MCP calls, Niv should have strategic workflows:
    pythonclass NivStrategicWorkflows:
        def campaign_launch_workflow(self, brief):
            """Niv's proven campaign launch sequence"""

            # Phase 1: Intelligence Gathering
            steps = [
                "1. Market Intelligence Scan",
                self.run_competitive_analysis(),  # signaldesk-intelligence
                self.check_media_narratives(),     # signaldesk-monitor
                self.identify_whitespace(),        # signaldesk-intelligence

                self.define_success_metrics()      # signaldesk-analytics

            return self.execute_with_insights(steps)

        def crisis_response_workflow(self, incident):
            """Niv's crisis management protocol"""

            # IMMEDIATE (0-4 hours)
            cascade_prediction = self.predict_cascade(incident)
            stakeholder_map = self.identify_affected_parties()
            holding_statement = self.generate_crisis_statement()

            # NEAR-TERM (4-24 hours)
            media_strategy = self.create_media_response_plan()
            monitoring = self.setup_real_time_monitoring()

            return self.strategic_recommendations()
6.  MEMORY & LEARNING SYSTEM
    Niv should build institutional knowledge:
    pythonclass NivMemorySystem:
        def capture_pattern(self, event, outcome):
            """Niv learns from every interaction"""

            # Store in signaldesk-memory
            self.add_to_memory({
                "pattern_type": "campaign_outcome",

                "actions_taken": event.actions,
                "results": outcome.metrics,
                "lessons_learned": self.extract_insights(outcome),
                "playbook_update": self.refine_strategy(outcome)
            })

        def retrieve_similar_situations(self, current_situation):
            """Niv recalls relevant past experiences"""

            similar = self.search_memory(
                query=current_situation,
                search_type="semantic"
            )

            return self.synthesize_recommendations(similar)
7.  PROACTIVE STRATEGIC GUIDANCE
    Niv shouldn't wait to be asked:
    pythonclass NivProactiveAdvisor:
        def daily_strategic_brief(self):
            """What Niv would tell you over morning coffee"""

            return f"""

8.  CONVERSATIONAL STRATEGY LAYER

    "surface_level_question": """

9. SUCCESS METRICS FOR NIV

Strategic Depth: Does Niv provide strategy, not just tactics?
Predictive Accuracy: How often do Niv's predictions come true?
Proactive Value: Does Niv surface non-obvious insights?
Learning Curve: Does Niv get smarter over time?
User Outcomes: Do campaigns perform better with Niv?

10. EXAMPLE: NIV IN ACTION
    User: "Should we respond to this negative article?"
    Basic Assistant: "Here's a press release template..."
    NIV:
    "I've seen this pattern 50+ times. Let me break this down:

SITUATION ANALYSIS:

- This journalist has written 3 negative pieces about your industry
- Your competitor responded last month - backfired spectacularly
- The narrative is shifting in 48 hours based on news cycle

STRATEGIC OPTIONS:

1. Silent Treatment (60% success rate in similar situations)
2. Indirect Response via Allied Voice (85% success rate)
3. Full Engagement with Conditions (40% success rate)

MY RECOMMENDATION: Option 2
Here's why: [detailed reasoning based on pattern matching]

EXECUTION PLAN:
Hour 1-4: [specific actions]
Hour 4-24: [specific actions]
Day 2-7: [specific actions]

BTW - this journalist is moving to Bloomberg next month (via signaldesk-intelligence).
Building a relationship now could pay dividends.

Want me to war-game the scenarios?"
