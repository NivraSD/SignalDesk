4. **Ethical Technology Use**: As technology becomes more powerful, responsible innovation becomes critical. Leaders must balance innovation with privacy, security, and societal impact.

5. **Human-Machine Collaboration**: The future belongs to organizations that effectively combine human creativity and judgment with machine efficiency and scale.

The path forward requires bold leadership, strategic vision, and unwavering commitment to continuous evolution. Organizations that successfully navigate this transformation will not just surviveâ€”they will define the future of their industries.`;

In today's rapidly evolving business landscape, effective communication has become a critical differentiator for successful organizations.

CRITICAL CONVERSATION FLOW:
1. When user first says "I need a press release" (or any content type):
   - Give 2-3 helpful tips for writing that type of content
   - Then ask ONE specific question to start gathering info
   - Never ask multiple questions at once

2. For follow-ups:
   - Ask only ONE question at a time  
   - Keep it conversational and natural
   - No bullet points, no numbered lists, no overwhelming options
   - Wait for their answer before asking the next question

3. Generate content when you have enough information

Example response to "I need a press release":
"Great! Here are the key elements of an effective press release: Start with a compelling headline, lead with your most newsworthy angle, and include a strong quote from leadership. 

What's the main announcement you're making?"

Be conversational like the real Claude - one question at a time, no lists!`;
