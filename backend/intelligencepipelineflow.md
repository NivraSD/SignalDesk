# Intelligence Pipeline Flow Documentation
**Last Updated: August 28, 2025**
**Status: PRODUCTION READY - Fully Deployed & Operational**

## Overview
The SignalDesk Intelligence Pipeline is a 6-stage AI-powered system that collects, analyzes, and synthesizes comprehensive intelligence about organizations. It discovers competitors, collects 100+ signals from 7 monitoring sources, and generates actionable PR opportunities through Claude AI analysis.

## Architecture
- **Backend**: Supabase Edge Functions (100% serverless)
- **Frontend**: React app deployed on Vercel
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL
- **AI**: Claude 3 Haiku for analysis
- **Monitoring**: 7 Active Sources (RSS, Firecrawl, Yahoo Finance, Google*, Reddit, Twitter, General Monitoring)
  * Google requires GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID configuration

## Pipeline Stages

### Stage 1: Organization Data Extraction
**Edge Functions**: 
- `intelligence-discovery-v3` - Discovers organization profile and 5+ competitors via Claude AI
- `organization-discovery` - Uses Claude to analyze organization and identify competitors
- `intelligence-collection-v1` - Collects signals from all monitoring systems

**Data Collection**:
- **Organization Discovery**: Claude AI identifies 5+ competitors (e.g., for OpenAI: DeepMind, Google AI, Microsoft Research, Meta AI, IBM Watson)
- **RSS Feeds**: 50 articles from technology/business feeds (no query filtering for max results)
- **Yahoo Finance**: All finance articles (40+ articles, no filtering)
- **Firecrawl**: Top 5 competitor websites analyzed
- **Reddit**: Searches across business, technology, stocks subreddits
- **Twitter/X**: Social mentions and discussions
- **Google News**: Requires GOOGLE_SEARCH_ENGINE_ID (currently not configured)
- **General Monitoring**: Real-time intelligence findings
- **Timeout**: 40 seconds for collection, 15 seconds per individual source

**Key Fix**: Enriched organization object with competitors passed to ALL monitoring functions

**Output**: 100+ signals with complete organization profile including competitors

## Timing & Performance

**Total Pipeline Duration**: 2-3 minutes
- Stage delays: 3 seconds between stages
- Claude AI processing: 10-30 seconds per stage
- Monitoring collection: 40 seconds max
- Individual collectors timeout: 15 seconds

**Data Volume** (After Fixes):
- Signals collected: **100-150+ per run** (was 20)
- Competitors discovered: **5+ per organization**
- Opportunities generated: 4-8 per run
- Data sources: **7 active monitoring systems**

- RSS Feeds: 50 articles

## Key Components

### Frontend
- **MultiStageIntelligence.js**: Orchestrates pipeline execution
  - Prevents parallel execution with `runningRef`
  - Prevents repetition with `completionRef`
  - 5-minute cache expiration for fresh runs
  - Extracts opportunities from `consolidated_opportunities.prioritized_list`
  - Resets properly when organization changes

- **intelligenceOrchestratorV4.js**: Handles stage communication
  - Calls edge functions sequentially
  - Manages stage transitions
  - Collects and passes results between stages

- **OpportunityEngine.js**: Displays opportunities
  - Loads from Supabase (not localStorage)
  - Extracts from synthesis stage: `data.data?.consolidated_opportunities?.prioritized_list`
  - Real-time opportunity updates

### Edge Functions (Supabase) - All Deployed ✅
All functions include:
- Claude AI integration (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY)
- Error handling and timeouts
- CORS headers
- Result persistence to Supabase
- Proper auth header passing

**Core Pipeline Functions**:

- `intelligence-collection-v1` - Multi-source signal collection
- `intelligence-stage-1-competitors` - Competitive analysis
- `intelligence-stage-2-media` - Media & stakeholder analysis
- `intelligence-stage-3-regulatory` - Regulatory analysis

## Opportunity Generation

Opportunities are generated at multiple stages and consolidated in synthesis:

1. **Stage-level opportunities**: Each stage can generate specific opportunities
2. **Synthesis consolidation**: All opportunities are prioritized and ranked
3. **Structure**:
```javascript
{
  opportunity: "Description",
  source_stage: "stage_name",
  type: "narrative|competitive|regulatory|trend",
  urgency: "high|medium|low",
  confidence: 85,
  pr_angle: "Specific PR approach",
  quick_summary: "Brief summary"
}
```

## Cache & Persistence

- **Supabase-only**: No localStorage for intelligence data
- **Cache expiration**: 5 minutes for analysis data
- **Organization profiles**: Stored in `intelligence_targets` table
- **Stage results**: Stored in `intelligence_findings` table
- **Opportunities**: Extracted from synthesis stage

## Critical Fixes Applied (August 28, 2025)

1. **Organization Discovery Fixed**:
   - `intelligence-discovery-v3` now handles string or object organization input
   - Always calls `organization-discovery` to get competitors from Claude
   - Fixed organization object references (was causing crashes)
   - Returns 5+ competitors at top level of response
   - Result: Proper competitor discovery (e.g., OpenAI → DeepMind, Google AI, etc.)

2. **Monitoring Collection Fixed**:
   - Created `enrichedOrg` object with competitors, keywords, industry
   - Passes enriched data to ALL monitoring functions (was missing)
   - Fixed response parsing: `data.data.articles` vs `data.articles`
   - Yahoo Finance: Removed strict filtering (was eliminating all results)
   - RSS: No query filtering for maximum results
   - Result: **100-150+ signals collected (was only 20)**

3. **Pipeline Execution Fixed**:
   - Added `runningRef` to prevent parallel execution
   - Added `completionRef` to prevent infinite repetition
   - Fixed useEffect dependencies
   - Proper organization change detection and reset
   - Stage delays: 3 seconds between stages

4. **Auth & API Fixes**:
   - Fixed hardcoded JWT tokens in monitoring functions
   - Proper auth header passing through collection chain
   - Added Google Search Engine ID check (not configured)
   - All monitoring functions use proper request format: `{ method: 'gather', params: {...} }`

## Testing

### Test Pipeline Locally
1. Open `/test-pipeline-live.html` in browser
2. Enter organization name
3. Click "Run Full Pipeline"
4. Monitor stage progress
5. View opportunities in output

### Verify Deployment
1. Check Vercel: https://signaldesk.vercel.app
2. Select/create organization
3. Watch Intelligence Hub progress
4. Verify opportunities display

## Troubleshooting

### Pipeline runs too fast (< 1 minute)
- Check if Claude AI is being called
- Verify edge function timeouts
- Check stage delays (should be 3s)

### Only 20 signals collected
- Verify RSS limit is 50
- Check Firecrawl competitor count
- Ensure monitoring timeout is 40s

### No opportunities showing
- Check synthesis stage output
- Verify `consolidated_opportunities.prioritized_list`
- Check OpportunityEngine loads from Supabase

### Parallel execution issues
- Verify `runningRef` guard in place
- Check useEffect dependencies
- Ensure single stage runs at a time
