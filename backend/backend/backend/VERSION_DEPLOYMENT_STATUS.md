## Frontend Version (What Should Be Deployed)

### Vercel Frontend Status
- **Current Deployment**: Working and updated
- **Domain**: https://signaldesk-frontend.vercel.app
- **Version Indicator**: v3.2-FIXED (should be visible in UI)

### Frontend Key Changes That Should Be Live
1. **RefreshCw Icon**: Fixed with inline SVG in RailwayDraggable.js line 754
2. **Version Display**: "v3.2-FIXED" in purple, bold text
3. **Activity List Height**: Fixed to 400px in RailwayDraggable.css
4. **Opportunity Engine Analysis**: Working analysis display feature
5. **Vercel Routing**: Fixed SPA routing with simplified rewrite rules

### Frontend File Contents We Need Deployed

#### /frontend/src/components/RailwayDraggable.js
**Key Lines That Must Be in Deployed Version**:
- Line 16: RefreshCw import OR inline SVG usage
- Line 728: Version indicator showing "v3.2-FIXED"
- Line 754: Refresh button with inline SVG or RefreshCw component

#### /frontend/src/components/OpportunityEngine.js
**Key Features That Must Work**:
- Analysis button functionality
- Strategic analysis display
- Proper integration with backend API

## Backend Version (What Should Be Deployed)

### Railway Backend Status
- **Domain**: https://signaldesk-production.up.railway.app
- **PROBLEM**: Not deploying latest changes
- **Current Deploy Time**: 2025-08-13T14:26:26.116Z (OLD)
- **Expected Commit**: 172abafa (NOT DEPLOYED)

### Backend Key Changes That Should Be Live (But Aren't)

#### /backend/railway.json (Latest Version)
```json
{
  "$schema": "https://railway.app/railway.schema.json",
  "build": {
    "builder": "NIXPACKS",
    "buildCommand": "npm ci --production=false"
  },
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "node backend/index.js",
    "healthcheckPath": "/api/health",
    "healthcheckTimeout": 60,
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 3
  }
}
```

#### /backend/server.js (Latest Version)
```javascript
// Railway entry point - redirects to the full server
const path = require('path');
console.log('🚀 Railway is running server.js from root');
console.log('📍 Current directory:', __dirname);
console.log('📍 Redirecting to backend/index.js (full server with all routes)...');
console.log('🔄 Deployment timestamp:', new Date().toISOString());

// Ensure we can find the backend directory
const backendPath = path.join(__dirname, 'backend', 'index.js');
console.log('📍 Looking for backend at:', backendPath);

// Check if the backend file exists
const fs = require('fs');
if (!fs.existsSync(backendPath)) {
  console.error('❌ Backend file not found at:', backendPath);
  console.log('📂 Available files in current directory:');
  fs.readdirSync(__dirname).forEach(file => {
    console.log('   -', file);
  });
  process.exit(1);
}

// Load the actual server
require(backendPath);
```

#### /backend/package.json (Key Changes)
```json
{
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
  }
}
```

## File Structure That Should Exist in Deployed Version

### Root Directory Structure
```
/Users/jonathanliebowitz/Desktop/SignalDesk/
├── backend/
│   ├── server.js                    # Entry point
│   ├── backend/
│   │   └── index.js                # Main server file
│   ├── package.json                # With main: "server.js"
│   └── railway.json                # With node backend/index.js
├── frontend/                       # Vercel deployment
└── [other files]
```

### Critical Files That Must Exist for Railway
- ✅ `/backend/server.js` (exists)
- ✅ `/backend/backend/index.js` (exists)  
- ✅ `/backend/package.json` (exists)
- ✅ `/backend/railway.json` (exists)

## Version Verification Commands

### Check Git Status
```bash
git log --oneline -1
git status
git diff HEAD~1
```

### Check Railway Deployment
```bash
curl -s https://signaldesk-production.up.railway.app/api/version
curl -s https://signaldesk-production.up.railway.app/
```

### Check Vercel Deployment  
```bash
curl -I https://signaldesk-frontend.vercel.app/login
# Should return 200, not 404
```

## What Railway Should Deploy vs What's Actually Deployed

### Expected Railway Deployment Behavior
1. **Trigger**: Auto-deploy on push to main branch
2. **Build**: Run `npm ci --production=false` from root
3. **Start**: Run `node backend/index.js` from root
4. **Health**: Check `/api/health` endpoint
5. **Result**: New deployment with commit 172abafa

### Current Railway Reality  
1. **Trigger**: ❌ No auto-deploy happening
2. **Build**: ❌ Not building latest code
3. **Start**: ❌ Running old version
4. **Health**: ✅ Old version still responding
5. **Result**: ❌ Stuck on old deployment

## Exact Features That Should Work When Properly Deployed

### Frontend Features (Vercel - Should Work)
- [ ] Version shows "v3.2-FIXED" next to SignalDesk logo
- [ ] Refresh button (↻) appears in project dropdown
- [ ] Activity list is exactly 400px height and scrollable
- [ ] Opportunity Engine "Analyze" shows strategic analysis
- [ ] No 404 errors on page refresh (/login should work)

### Backend Features (Railway - Currently Broken)
- [ ] `/api/health` returns current timestamp
- [ ] `/api/version` shows commit 172abafa
- [ ] All AI endpoints work with latest code
- [ ] Authentication works with latest code
- [ ] Database connections work

### Integration Features (Frontend + Backend)
- [ ] Frontend can login with demo@signaldesk.com / demo123
- [ ] AI Assistant responds correctly
- [ ] Content Generator creates real content
- [ ] Opportunity Engine connects to backend
- [ ] All data persists correctly

## Next Steps Required

1. **Manual Railway Deployment**:
   - Go to Railway dashboard
   - Find SignalDesk backend service  
   - Click "Deploy" or "Redeploy"
   - Monitor build logs

2. **Verify File Existence**:
   - Confirm all files exist in Railway's view of repository
   - Check if Railway can see commit 172abafa
   - Verify railway.json is being read

3. **Check Auto-Deploy Settings**:
   - Verify GitHub webhook is connected
   - Check if branch protection or other rules are blocking
   - Confirm Railway has permission to read repository

4. **Test Manual Build**:
   - Try building locally with same commands Railway should use
   - Verify `npm ci --production=false` works
   - Verify `node backend/index.js` starts server

---

**CRITICAL**: Until Railway deploys commit 172abafa with the fixed configuration, the backend will remain broken and none of the recent improvements will be live.
