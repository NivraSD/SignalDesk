   - PostgreSQL database needs demo user added
   - Use SQL commands in `add-demo-user.sql`
   - Railway PostgreSQL connection string needs verification

2. **Claude AI Integration**
   - ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set in Railway
   - Endpoints need to be added to simplified server
   - Full backend with all routes needs to be deployed after testing

## Files Created

### Test Scripts
- `test-railway-login.js` - Comprehensive Node.js test suite
- `test-railway-complete.html` - Browser-based test interface
- `check-railway-deployment.sh` - Shell script for deployment monitoring
- `monitor-railway-deployment.sh` - Automated deployment monitoring

### SQL Scripts
- `add-demo-user.sql` - SQL commands to add demo user to PostgreSQL

### Server Files
- `server.js` - Simplified server for Railway (currently deployed)
- `server.js.backup` - Original complex server (backup)
- `backend/src/routes/authRoutes.js` - Updated auth routes with demo fallback

---

## How to Test

### 1. Browser Testing
Open `test-railway-complete.html` in a browser and click "Run All Tests"

### 2. Command Line Testing
```bash
# Run comprehensive test
node test-railway-login.js

# Monitor deployment
./monitor-railway-deployment.sh

# Check Railway logs
railway logs
```

### 3. Manual Testing
```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://signaldesk-production.up.railway.app/api/health

# Test login
curl -X POST https://signaldesk-production.up.railway.app/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"demo@signaldesk.com","password":"Demo123"}'
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Add Demo User to Database**
   ```bash
   # Connect to Railway PostgreSQL
   railway connect postgres
   
   # Run SQL commands from add-demo-user.sql
   ```

2. **Deploy Full Backend**
   Once demo user is working, restore the full backend:
   ```bash
   cp server.js.backup server.js
   git add server.js
   git commit -m "Restore full backend with all features"
   git push
   ```

3. **Test Claude AI Features**
   - Verify ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is set
   - Test content generation endpoints
   - Monitor for any errors in Railway logs

4. **Frontend Integration**
   - Frontend at: https://signaldesk.vercel.app
   - Should now be able to login with demo user
   - Test all features after successful login

## Environment Variables Required

In Railway dashboard, ensure these are set:

- ✅ `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` - Set for Claude AI
- ⚠️ `DATABASE_URL` - Needs verification
- ⚠️ `JWT_SECRET` - Optional (using default)

---

## Troubleshooting

If login fails:
1. Check Railway logs: `railway logs`
2. Verify deployment status: `railway status`
3. Test with simplified credentials
4. Check CORS settings in browser console

If 502 errors return:
1. Server may be restarting
2. Check for syntax errors in server.js
3. Verify all dependencies in package.json
4. Monitor Railway dashboard for build errors

---

## Success Metrics

- ✅ Health endpoint returns 200
- ✅ Login with demo user works
- ✅ Token generation successful
- ✅ Token verification works
- ⚠️ Database connection pending
- ⚠️ Claude AI integration pending

---

## Contact for Issues

If deployment issues persist:
1. Check Railway dashboard for build logs
2. Review server.js for any syntax errors
3. Ensure all npm dependencies are listed in package.json
4. Verify environment variables are set correctly
