SignalDesk Optimization: Opportunity Discovery Implementation Guide
Executive Summary
This document outlines the practical implementation of Opportunity Discovery features for SignalDesk, including specific formulas, data requirements, and integration strategies. The goal is to transform SignalDesk from a PR execution platform into an intelligence system that discovers opportunities clients didn't know existed.

this.dashboards = new OpportunityDashboards();
}
}

Next Steps

1. Technical Architecture Review: Ensure infrastructure can handle new data volume
2. Data Source Prioritization: Contract with highest-value data providers first
3. Client Selection: Choose 5 beta clients with different profiles
4. Team Training: Ensure success team understands opportunity coaching
5. Pricing Strategy: Develop opportunity-based pricing tiers
   Conclusion
   By implementing this optimization plan, SignalDesk evolves from a PR execution platform to an opportunity discovery engine. The formulas provide quantifiable, actionable intelligence. The integration enhances existing features. The profiling ensures realistic recommendations.
   This is the bridge from SignalDesk to Cascade Intelligence - starting with PR opportunities and expanding to see how everything connects to everything else.
