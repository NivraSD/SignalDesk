# SIMPLE FIX - Let's Use ONE Vercel Deployment

## Your Working URLs:
- **Frontend (Vercel):** https://signaldesk-frontend-dxe1q1aqj-nivra-sd.vercel.app (most recent, 4 min ago)
- **Backend (Railway):** https://signaldesk-production.up.railway.app

## THE ONE FIX YOU NEED:

Go to Vercel Dashboard:
1. Go to https://vercel.com/nivra-sd/signaldesk-frontend/settings/environment-variables
2. Find `REACT_APP_API_URL`
3. Make sure it's set to: `https://signaldesk-production.up.railway.app` (NO /api at the end!)
4. Click Save
5. Redeploy by clicking "Redeploy" on the latest deployment

## Test It Works:
Open: https://signaldesk-frontend-dxe1q1aqj-nivra-sd.vercel.app

Try:
1. Login
2. Generate some content
3. Use AI chat

## Clean Up Later (Optional):
You have multiple deployments but they're all the same project. Each deploy creates a new URL. This is normal for Vercel. The latest one is always the current production.

## STOP DEPLOYING NEW ONES
Just use the existing deployment. No more `vercel --prod` commands needed unless you change code.
