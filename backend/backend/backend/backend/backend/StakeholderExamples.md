# Stakeholder Intelligence System - Real Examples

## Example 1: Setting Up an Institutional Investor Group

### Scenario: BlackRock Investment Group
Your company wants to track BlackRock's sentiment and investment decisions as they hold 8% of your shares.

```javascript

## Integration Workflow

```javascript
// How it all works together
const StakeholderIntelligenceWorkflow = {
  // 1. Continuous Monitoring
  continuousMonitoring: async () => {
    for (const stakeholder of activeStakeholders) {
      // Process each source
      for (const source of stakeholder.sources) {
        const content = await fetchSourceContent(source);
        const intelligence = await extractIntelligence(content, stakeholder.extractionRules);
        
        if (intelligence.relevance > threshold) {
          await processIntelligence(intelligence, stakeholder);
        }
      }
    }
  },

  // 2. Scheduled Research
  scheduledResearch: async () => {
    const dueResearch = getScheduledResearchTasks();
    
    for (const task of dueResearch) {
      const orchestratorResult = await researchOrchestrator.execute({
        query: task.query,
        context: task.stakeholder,
        agents: task.agents
      });
      
      await updateStakeholderIntelligence(task.stakeholder, orchestratorResult);
    }
  },

  // 3. Triggered Deep Dives
  handleTrigger: async (event) => {
    const affectedStakeholders = identifyAffectedStakeholders(event);
    
    for (const stakeholder of affectedStakeholders) {
      const deepDiveQuery = generateEventSpecificQuery(event, stakeholder);
      const urgentResearch = await researchOrchestrator.executePriority({
        query: deepDiveQuery,
        urgency: "high",
        depth: "comprehensive"
      });
      
      await alertTeam(stakeholder, urgentResearch);
    }
  }
};
```

This system gives you:
1. **Comprehensive source coverage** for each stakeholder type
2. **Organization-specific intelligence extraction** 
3. **Automated research orchestration** for deep insights
4. **Real-time alerts** on critical changes
5. **Predictive intelligence** based on patterns

The beauty is that once configured, it runs automatically, surfacing only the most relevant, actionable intelligence about each stakeholder's relationship with your organization.
