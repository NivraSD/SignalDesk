# SignalDesk Monitoring Capabilities & Sources

## Overview
This document outlines the current monitoring capabilities, data sources, and intelligence gathering features implemented in the SignalDesk platform.

## Current Architecture

### 1. Intelligence Targets
SignalDesk monitors two primary types of targets:
- **Competitors**: Other companies in your space
- **Topics**: Industry themes, technologies, or trends

Each target can have:
- Custom RSS feeds
- Keywords for searching
- Priority levels (high/medium/low)
- Active/inactive status

### 2. Data Sources

#### Currently Implemented Sources

##### RSS Feeds (Primary Source)
The platform uses RSS feeds as its primary data source for monitoring:

**Default RSS Feeds**:
```javascript
// Technology & Business News
- https://techcrunch.com/feed/
- https://www.theverge.com/rss/index.xml
- https://feeds.feedburner.com/venturebeat/SZYF
- https://www.prnewswire.com/rss/news-releases-list.rss

// Can be customized per target via EnhancedSourceConfigurator
```

**Custom RSS Configuration**:
- Users can add unlimited custom RSS feeds per target
- AI-powered RSS feed discovery based on target profile
- Real-time feed validation
- Automatic parsing and content extraction

##### AI-Powered Source Discovery
The platform includes an AI agent that suggests relevant RSS feeds:
```javascript
// Discovers feeds based on:
- Target name and type
- Industry context
- Geographic relevance
- Content freshness
```

### 3. Monitoring Capabilities

#### A. Competitor Health Monitoring
Analyzes competitors across four key dimensions:

**1. Financial Signals**
- Revenue indicators
- Funding announcements
- Financial performance mentions
- Investment activities

**2. Leadership Signals**
- Executive changes
- Key hires/departures
- Board modifications
- Strategic appointments

**3. Product Signals**
- Product launches
- Feature updates
- Service expansions
- Technology adoptions

**4. Partnership Signals**
- Strategic alliances
- Joint ventures
- Customer wins/losses
- Ecosystem developments

**Health Score Calculation**: 0-100 composite score based on all signals

#### B. Topic Positioning Analysis
Evaluates how competitors are positioned on key topics:

**Positioning Levels**:
- **Strong**: Dominant presence, thought leadership
- **Moderate**: Active participation, some visibility
- **Weak**: Minimal presence, reactive stance
- **None**: No meaningful activity detected

**Analysis Factors**:
- Mention frequency
- Content depth
- Sentiment analysis
- Engagement levels

#### C. Trend Detection
- Identifies emerging themes in monitored content
- Tracks topic velocity (growing/stable/declining)
- Highlights narrative shifts
- Spots market opportunities

### 4. Intelligence Processing Pipeline

```

#### Unified Intelligence View
Combines competitor and topic analysis to show:
- How each competitor is positioned on each topic
- Market landscape visualization
- Strategic opportunity identification
- Competitive blind spots

### 6. Monitoring Features

#### Real-Time Monitoring
- Continuous feed polling (configurable intervals)

### 7. Data Management

#### Storage
- PostgreSQL database for all findings
- Structured data model:
  - `findings` table: Raw intelligence data
  - `intelligence_targets`: Monitored entities
  - `target_sources`: RSS feed configurations
  - `opportunities`: Identified strategic opportunities

#### Data Retention
- All findings stored indefinitely
- Historical analysis available
- Audit trail maintained
- Export capabilities (planned)

### 8. Integration Points

#### Current Integrations
- **Claude AI API**: For intelligent analysis
- **RSS Parser**: For feed processing
- **Web Scraping**: Basic article extraction

#### API Endpoints
```javascript
// Monitoring Control

### 9. Limitations & Considerations

#### Current Limitations
1. **Source Types**: Currently limited to RSS feeds
2. **Rate Limiting**: Depends on source feed update frequency
3. **Content Access**: Limited to publicly available content
4. **Language**: English-only analysis
5. **Real-time**: Near real-time, not instant

#### Planned Enhancements
1. **Additional Sources**:
   - Social media monitoring
   - API integrations (when available)
   - Web scraping expansion
   - Email newsletter monitoring

2. **Advanced Analysis**:
   - Multi-language support
   - Image/video analysis
   - Predictive modeling
   - Custom ML models

3. **Workflow Automation**:
