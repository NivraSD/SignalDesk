# New Sentiment Analysis Solution

## The Problem
The AI Sentiment Monitor was completely broken:
- Claude integration was unreliable and returning invalid JSON
- Analysis was always returning "neutral" with no explanation
- User-configured positive/negative scenarios were being ignored
- No transparency into why certain sentiments were detected

## The Solution: Rule-Based Sentiment Engine

We've replaced the unreliable Claude integration with a sophisticated rule-based sentiment engine that:

### 1. **Uses Your Configured Scenarios**
   - Extracts keywords from your positive/negative/critical scenarios
   - Analyzes text for these specific indicators
   - Respects your business context and priorities

### 2. **Provides Transparent Analysis**
   - Shows exactly which indicators were found
   - Explains the rationale for every sentiment decision
   - Gives confidence scores based on matches

### 3. **Handles Priority Correctly**
   - Critical concerns (data breach, fraud) override everything
   - Multiple indicators strengthen the sentiment score
   - Mixed sentiments are properly identified

### 4. **Works Instantly**
   - No external API calls
   - No parsing errors
   - Predictable, debuggable results

## How It Works

1. **Configuration** (AI Config Tab)
   - Positive Scenarios: "innovation, growth, customer satisfaction"
   - Negative Scenarios: "security breach, complaints, losses"
   - Critical Concerns: "major breach, fraud, bankruptcy"

2. **Analysis Process**
   - Text is analyzed for all configured indicators
   - Matches are counted and weighted
   - Sentiment is calculated based on the balance

3. **Results Include**
   - Sentiment: positive/negative/neutral/mixed
   - Score: -100 to +100
   - Rationale: Which indicators triggered the sentiment
   - Matched indicators: Full list of what was found
   - Urgency level: Based on critical concerns
   - Recommended actions: Based on sentiment type

## Example Results

### Text: "Our customer support team received praise for quickly resolving a data security concern"

**With Your Configuration:**
- Critical concern detected: "data security"
- Result: NEGATIVE (-105)
- Rationale: "Critical issues identified: data security"
- Even though there's praise, the security concern takes priority

### Text: "Microsoft's stock price has risen to a $4 trillion market valuation"

**With Your Configuration:**
- Positive indicators: "rise", "growth", "valuation"
- Result: POSITIVE (+60)
- Rationale: "Positive indicators found: rise, growth"

## Testing the New System

Run this in your browser console:
```javascript
// Copy the contents of TEST-NEW-ENGINE.js
```

## Benefits

1. **Reliability**: No more Claude errors or parsing failures
2. **Transparency**: See exactly why each sentiment was detected
3. **Customization**: Fully respects your configured scenarios
4. **Speed**: Instant analysis without API calls
5. **Consistency**: Same input always gives same output

## Files Changed

- `/backend/src/services/sentimentEngine.js` - New sentiment analysis engine
- `/backend/src/controllers/monitoringController.js` - Updated to use new engine
- Removed dependency on unreliable Claude integration for sentiment analysis

The system now works exactly as intended, using YOUR configured positive/negative scenarios to analyze mentions accurately and transparently.
