# üöÄ SignalDesk Functionality Restoration Guide

## ‚úÖ Your Claude API Key is VALID!

Your API key has been tested and confirmed working:
```
YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_HERE
```

## üìã Step-by-Step Restoration Process

### Step 1: Update Railway Environment Variable (CRITICAL!)

1. Go to your Railway Dashboard: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Click on your backend service (signaldesk-production)
3. Go to the **Variables** tab
4. Add or Update this variable:
   - **Variable Name:** `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - **Variable Value:** `YOUR_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY_HERE`
5. Click **Add** or **Update**
6. Railway will automatically redeploy with the new key

### Step 2: Deploy Backend Fixes

The fixes have already been created in your codebase. Now deploy them:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd /Users/jonathanliebowitz/Desktop/SignalDesk

# Add all the fixes
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Fix Claude AI integration - restore full functionality with updated API key"

# Push to trigger Railway deployment
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Monitor Deployment

Watch the Railway deployment:
```bash
# View deployment logs
railway logs --tail

# Or check in Railway dashboard
# https://railway.app/dashboard -> Your Service -> Deployments
```

### Step 4: Verify Claude is Working

Once deployed (takes ~2-3 minutes), test that Claude is working:

```bash
# Test health endpoint
curl https://signaldesk-production.up.railway.app/api/health/detailed

# You should see:
# "claudeStatus": "operational"
# "apiKeyConfigured": true
```

### Step 5: Test Each Feature

Open the test dashboard in your browser:
1. Open: `/Users/jonathanliebowitz/Desktop/SignalDesk/backend/src/agents/test-all-features.html`
2. Enter your URLs:
   - Frontend: `https://signaldesk-frontend-*.vercel.app`
   - Backend: `https://signaldesk-production.up.railway.app`
3. Click "Run All Tests"

### Step 6: Update Vercel Frontend (if needed)

If frontend is still having issues:

1. Go to Vercel Dashboard: https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your SignalDesk frontend project
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables**
4. Ensure this is set:
   - `REACT_APP_API_URL` = `https://signaldesk-production.up.railway.app/api`
5. Click **Save**
6. Go to **Deployments** ‚Üí Click **Redeploy** on the latest deployment

## üîç What Gets Fixed

With the correct API key in Railway, these features will be restored:

‚úÖ **Crisis Command Center** - Real AI-generated crisis plans
‚úÖ **Content Generator** - Unique content with tone/audience targeting  
‚úÖ **Campaign Intelligence** - Strategic campaign analysis
‚úÖ **PR Assistant** - Professional PR advice
‚úÖ **Stakeholder Intelligence** - Stakeholder mapping
‚úÖ **Opportunity Finder** - Market opportunity identification
‚úÖ **Media List Builder** - AI-powered journalist discovery
‚úÖ **Media Monitoring** - Sentiment analysis and alerts
‚úÖ **Memory Vault** - Context storage (with folder fix)

## üö® Troubleshooting

### If Claude Still Returns Mock Data:

1. **Check Railway Logs:**
   ```bash
   railway logs | grep "Claude"
   ```
   Look for:
   - "‚úÖ API Key found: true"
   - "Claude service initialized"

2. **Force Railway Redeploy:**
   ```bash
   git commit --allow-empty -m "Force Railway redeploy with new API key"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Test Individual Endpoints:**
   ```bash
   # Test crisis endpoint
   curl -X POST https://signaldesk-production.up.railway.app/api/crisis/generate-plan \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"situation":"test crisis"}'
   ```

### If Frontend Can't Connect:

1. Check browser console for CORS errors
2. Verify backend is running: `curl https://signaldesk-production.up.railway.app/`
3. Clear browser cache and cookies
4. Try incognito/private browsing mode

## üìä Success Indicators

You'll know everything is working when:

1. `/api/health/detailed` shows:
   - ‚úÖ `"status": "healthy"`
   - ‚úÖ `"claudeStatus": "operational"`
   - ‚úÖ `"apiKeyConfigured": true`

2. Feature endpoints return:
   - Unique, contextual responses (not generic templates)
   - Different responses each time (not cached/mock data)
   - Properly formatted JSON

3. Frontend shows:
   - All features loading without errors
   - Real-time AI responses
   - No "mock data" indicators

## üéØ Expected Timeline

- **Railway deployment**: 2-3 minutes after git push
- **Vercel deployment**: 1-2 minutes after settings change
- **Full functionality restored**: Within 5 minutes total

## üí° Final Checks

After deployment, verify these critical features:

```bash
# 1. Crisis Management
curl -X POST https://signaldesk-production.up.railway.app/api/crisis/generate-plan \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"situation":"Product recall needed", "severity":"high"}'

# 2. Content Generation  
curl -X POST https://signaldesk-production.up.railway.app/api/content/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"topic":"New product launch", "tone":"professional"}'

# 3. Media Search
curl -X POST https://signaldesk-production.up.railway.app/api/media/search-journalists \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"tech journalists san francisco"}'
```

Each should return unique, AI-generated content, not templates or mock data.
