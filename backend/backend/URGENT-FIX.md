# URGENT FIX - Your Backend URL Changed!

## The Problem
Your Railway backend URL changed from:
- OLD: `signaldesk-backend-production-f0b8.up.railway.app`  
- NEW: `signaldesk-production.up.railway.app`

That's why nothing works - the frontend is calling the wrong URL!

## Fix it NOW (2 options):

### Option 1: Update Vercel Environment Variable
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your SignalDesk project
3. Go to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
4. Find `REACT_APP_API_URL`
5. Change it to: `https://signaldesk-production.up.railway.app`
6. Save and redeploy

### Option 2: Command Line
```bash
cd frontend
vercel env add REACT_APP_API_URL production
# When prompted, enter: https://signaldesk-production.up.railway.app
vercel --prod
```

## Test it Works
Once updated, test with:
```bash
curl https://signaldesk-production.up.railway.app/api/health
```

Should return a success response.

## Why This Happened
Railway sometimes changes URLs when you redeploy or modify services. Always check the Railway dashboard for the current URL when things stop working!
