# SignalDesk Platform - Complete Session Summary

## üéØ Core Mission
Build a real-time monitoring platform that tracks ANY organization's media coverage, competitors, and industry topics - then uses Claude research agents to analyze patterns and identify strategic opportunities.

**Critical Requirement**: System must be a blank slate - users input ANY organization, system discovers competitors/topics, configures sources dynamically, and monitors continuously. NOT pre-configured for specific companies.

## üö® Current System Status

### What's Working
1. **Backend Intelligence Analysis** ‚úÖ
   - IntelligenceAnalysisService.js uses Claude research agents to analyze 90+ articles per cycle
   - Coverage-focused analysis (NOT company analysis) - analyzes media coverage patterns
   - Identifies narrative gaps, competitive coverage, and strategic opportunities
   - Located at: `/backend/src/services/IntelligenceAnalysisService.js`

2. **Frontend Components** ‚úÖ
   - AutomatedOrganizationSetup.js - Analyzes any organization and discovers competitors/topics
   - IntelligenceSummaryDashboard.js - Displays analyzed intelligence with Opportunities tab
   - Public API access via localtunnel: `https://six-tables-write.loca.lt`

3. **Database Schema** ‚úÖ
   - 18 complete tables for full platform functionality
   - Proper UUID organization IDs (no "org-" prefix)
   - Fixed constraints on intelligence_targets and organization_sources

### Known Issues & Fixes Applied

#### 1. Railway/Render Deployment Issues
- **Railway**: "Application failed to respond" - Database connected but app wouldn't start
- **Render**: Similar deployment issues
- **Solution**: Pivoted to localtunnel for public access instead
- **Current Setup**: 
  - Backend: localhost:5001
  - Frontend: localhost:3000  
  - Public API: https://six-tables-write.loca.lt

#### 2. Database Constraint Errors
```sql
-- Fixed with these commands:
DELETE FROM intelligence_targets a
USING intelligence_targets b
WHERE a.id > b.id 
AND a.organization_id = b.organization_id 
AND a.name = b.name 
AND a.type = b.type;

ALTER TABLE intelligence_targets 
ADD CONSTRAINT intelligence_targets_unique 
UNIQUE (organization_id, name, type);

ALTER TABLE organization_sources 
ADD CONSTRAINT organization_sources_unique 
UNIQUE (organization_id, source_url);

ALTER TABLE organization_sources 
ADD CONSTRAINT organization_sources_query_unique 
UNIQUE (organization_id, source_query);
```

#### 3. Module Path Issues
- **Error**: "Cannot find module '../config/claude'"
- **Fix**: Correct path is `../../config/claude` from services folder

   - Where the organization can insert itself

2. **Research Agents**: Uses Claude to analyze articles in batches, extracting:
   - Coverage volume and sentiment
   - Narrative patterns
   - Coverage gaps
   - Strategic opportunities

3. **Opportunity Types**:
   - **Narrative Vacuum** - Topics with no coverage
   - **Counter-Narrative** - Challenging competitor narratives
   - **First-Mover Coverage** - Emerging topics
   - **Coverage Hijacking** - Redirecting trending topics

4. **Dynamic Configuration**: System adapts to ANY organization by:
   - Analyzing the company with Claude
   - Discovering relevant competitors and topics
   - Mapping to appropriate news sources
   - Creating custom search queries

## üîó Active Test Organizations

## üìå Final Notes

The platform is functional but needs refinement. The core intelligence analysis with research agents is working well, producing actionable opportunities from coverage analysis. The main issue is ensuring source configuration completes successfully when users set up new organizations.

The system successfully pivoted from pre-configured monitoring to a dynamic, blank-slate approach that works for ANY organization - this was the critical requirement from user feedback.

Coverage analysis (not company analysis) is now the focus, identifying gaps and opportunities in media narratives rather than analyzing the companies themselves.
