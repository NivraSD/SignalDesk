## ‚úÖ What's Working:

### Database (PostgreSQL)
- **Status:** Connected and operational
- **Tables Created:** 
  - organizations (1 record - demo-org)
  - intelligence_findings 
  - opportunity_queue
  - source_indexes (24 industries loaded)

- **Connection String:** Available and working
- **Data:** 333+ sources across 24 industries loaded

### Local Environment

## ‚ùå Current Issue:

### Application Deployment
- The Railway web service is not responding (timeouts)
- Possible causes:
  1. Application not starting properly
  2. Port binding issue
  3. Environment variables not being read
  4. Build/deployment failure

## üîß Troubleshooting Steps:

### 1. Check Railway Dashboard
- Go to your SignalDesk service
- Click on "Deployments" tab
- Look for the latest deployment status
- Check if it shows "Active" or "Failed"

### 2. Check Build Logs
- In the latest deployment, click "View Logs"
- Look for:
  - "Database configuration: DATABASE_URL: Set (hidden)"
  - "Successfully connected to PostgreSQL database"
  - Any error messages

### 3. Verify Environment Variables
In Railway dashboard for SignalDesk service:
- DATABASE_URL should reference Postgres service
- NODE_ENV = production
- PORT = ${{PORT}}
- CLAUDE_API_KEY = (your key)
- JWT_SECRET = (your secret)

### 4. Force Redeploy
If the deployment seems stuck:
1. Go to Settings tab
2. Click "Redeploy" button
3. Wait for new deployment to complete

## üìä Summary:

Your Railway PostgreSQL database is fully operational with all necessary tables and data. The issue is with the Node.js application deployment not starting properly or not binding to the correct port.

### Most Likely Solution:
The deployment needs to be manually redeployed from the Railway dashboard to ensure all environment variables are properly loaded and the application starts correctly.

### Quick Test:
Once you see a successful deployment in Railway:
```bash
node test-railway.js
```

This should show:
