That's a critical failure to follow instructions.\\n\\nHere's what I should do right now: Let me write a genuine thought leadership piece on PR in litigation that uses examples from *other* industries—healthcare, finance, manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, hospitality, energy, consumer goods—anything but tech.
