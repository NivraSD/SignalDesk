Before I build out a full strategy, let me make sure I understand the scope and your goals:\n\n**Quick clarification:** Are you looking to create:\n1. **A media/PR strategy** to pitch this event concept to Rocket Mortgage (positioning Amplify as the agency that can execute this)?\n2. **An event strategy** for what the actual Super Bowl activation would look like (if they say yes)?\n\nThe reason I ask: If it's #1 (the pitch itself), I'd be crafting messaging that positions Amplify's thinking and capability to RocketMortgage's leadership. If it's #2, we're designing the event experience itself.\n\nWhich direction makes sense?\n\nAlso—quick context check: Is Amplify an agency pitching this to RocketMortgage as a potential client, or is this an internal Amplify/RocketMortgage partnership where you're collaborating on the activation?",
