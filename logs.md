The average enrolled New York household receives $376 per month from the program, which is also a significant source of revenue for the state’s retailers and farmers. Governor Kathy Hochul is facing calls to fund food benefits during the shutdown, but she has so far said the state can’t afford to.<br>Here’s what you need to know. |\n| [READ THE FULL STORY](https://nysfocus.com/2025/10/30/snap-trump-shutdown-november) | |\n\n| |\n| --- |\n| | |\n| --- |\n| ### Recent Stories | |\n\n| |\n| --- |\n| | |\n| --- |\n| |\n| | |\n| --- |\n| ![](https://nysfocus.com/assets/_1200x

"message": "I apologize — that research came back with irrelevant results. Let me work with what we know strategically about Rocket Mortgage and Super Bowl activations to build you a compelling pitch deck.\n\nHere's what I'm thinking for your pitch structure:\n\n**Strategic Approach for the Pitch:**\n\nYour \"Comfort\" angle is strong because it:\n- Addresses Rocket Mortgage's core positioning (making mortgages simple, transparent, stress-free)\n- Taps into a genuine pain point for their target audience (first-time buyers ARE anxious)\n- Creates an experiential moment at the Super Bowl that goes beyond traditional ads\n- Generates word-of-mouth and social currency around their brand\n\n**What I'd recommend for the pitch deck:**\n\n1. **Opening** — The problem: first-time homebuyer anxiety is real and costly (affects conversion rates)\n2. **Context** — Why Super Bowl + why NOW (market timing, competitor activity, consumer mindset during major cultural moments)\n3. **Your Concept** — The \"Comfort\" event idea with clear activation details\n4. **Audience Impact** — Who attends, what they experience, emotional takeaway\n5. **Business Case** — Reach, engagement metrics, brand lift potential, sponsorship ROI\n6. **Implementation** — Timeline, logistics, investment\n7. **Close** — Clear call-to-action\n\nBefore I create the full deck, one clarifying question: **Do you already have specific details about the event itself?** (Like: Is this an on-site Super Bowl experience? A virtual/digital moment? What's the actual \"comfort\" experience — like a lounge, an interactive installation, etc.?)\n\nThis will help me tailor the pitch to match your creative vision exactly.",

"message": "Great — on-site activation at the Super Bowl gives us real tangible value to pitch. Let me think through some \"comfort\" experience concepts that would resonate with first-time homebuyers and showcase Rocket Mortgage's positioning:\n\n**On-Site \"Comfort\" Experience Concepts:**\n\n1. **The Comfort Lounge** — A sanctuary-style space designed to feel like \"home.\" Soft lighting, comfortable seating, calming design. Inside: stations where first-time buyers can explore home ownership fears in a judgment-free environment. Staff guides them through simplified mortgage scenarios using Rocket Mortgage's digital tools. The emotional payoff: \"You don't have to figure this out alone.\" Takeaway: branded \"comfort kit\" with resources.\n\n2. **\"First Home\" Photo Installation** — Interactive space where attendees share their home ownership dreams/fears via photo or video. Real stories displayed in real-time on large screens. Creates community around the anxiety narrative. Rocket Mortgage becomes the brand that \"gets it.\" Strong social amplification (Super Bowl crowd posting).\n\n3. **Comfort Checkpoint** — A guided journey through 5 \"anxiety stations\" (down payment fears, credit concerns, rate shopping confusion, etc.) where Rocket Mortgage experts demystify each one with live demos of their app/platform. Each station has a \"comfort moment\" — simple, relatable explanation that reduces perceived complexity.\n\n4. **The Comfort Kitchen** — Experiential space styled like a home kitchen where attendees gather for short talks from real Rocket Mortgage customers (first-time buyers) sharing their journey. Creates authenticity and peer validation. Casual, intimate vibe despite being at the Super Bowl.\n\n**My question for you:** \n\nWhich of these resonates most with your creative vision? Or do you want me to **synthesize elements from multiple concepts** into one cohesive experience? (For example: The Comfort Lounge as the anchor space, with the Photo Installation as a centerpiece feature and live customer stories throughout.)\n\nOnce we lock the experience concept, I'll create the full pitch deck with all the supporting materials.",
