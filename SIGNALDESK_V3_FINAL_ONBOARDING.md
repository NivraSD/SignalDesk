```typescript
interface UserJourney {
  // 1. Enter basics (30 sec)
  start: {
    enters: ["email", "password", "Tesla", "tesla.com"],
    sees: "Pipeline immediately starts extracting data"
  }
  
  // 2. Select goals while pipeline runs (45 sec)

}
```

## WHY THIS WORKS

### 1. Simple Input
- Only needs company name and URL
- Pipeline extracts everything else
- No tedious forms

### 2. Continuous Value Display
- Users see intelligence building while setting up
- Not waiting - watching value creation
- Live feed creates excitement

### 3. Real Intelligence
- Actual pipeline running (2-3 minutes)
- Real data being extracted
- Real opportunities detected

### 4. Immediate Value
- Users finish with actionable opportunities
- Not just "setup complete" but "ready to execute"
- Urgency drives immediate action

## KEY TECHNICAL POINTS

### Pipeline Runs During Onboarding
```typescript
// Start pipeline immediately after company/URL entered
const startOnboarding = async (company: string, url: string) => {
  // Start pipeline in background
  const pipelinePromise = runIntelligencePipeline({ 
    organization: company,
    domain: url 
  })
  
  // Continue with goal selection while pipeline runs
  // Show live updates as stages complete
  // By the time user finishes, pipeline is done
  
  const intelligence = await pipelinePromise
  const opportunities = detectOpportunities(intelligence, userGoals)
  
  return { intelligence, opportunities }
}
```

### Live Updates via Subscriptions
```typescript
// Real-time updates during onboarding
const { data: pipelineStatus } = useSubscription('pipeline-progress', {
  onData: (update) => {
    // Show in live feed
    addToLiveFeed(update.message)
    // Update progress bar
    setProgress(update.progress)
  }
})
```

---

## ALERT SYSTEM INTEGRATION

### Focus on What Matters
```typescript
interface OnboardingAlerts {
  // Set up during onboarding based on goals
  setupAlerts: {
    opportunities: {
      enabled: true,
      threshold: "Based on goal - thought leadership = speaking opps"
    },
    crisis: {
      enabled: true,
      immediate: "Always for threats"
    },
    deadlines: {
      enabled: true,
      reminder: "24hr and 2hr warnings"
    }
  }
  
  // First alert
  immediateAlert: {
    type: "opportunity",
    message: "High-priority opportunity expires in 4 hours",
    action: "Creates urgency to engage immediately"
  }
}
```

## MEMORYVAULT INTEGRATION

### Start Building Memory from Day 1
```typescript
interface OnboardingMemoryVault {
  // Store everything from onboarding
  store: {
    goals: "User's strategic objectives",
    uploads: "Any materials provided",
    firstIntelligence: "Baseline intelligence snapshot",
    firstOpportunities: "Initial opportunities for pattern learning"
  }
  
  // Begin pattern recognition
  startLearning: {
    from: "User's goals and uploads",
    creates: "Initial campaign templates",
    prepares: "Personalized strategies"
