# Vercel Build Fix - tsconfig.json Missing

## Issue
Multiple Vercel deployments were failing with immediate errors (0ms build time). The builds showed "● Error" status without detailed error messages.

## Timeline
- **Age: 2m-11m** - Multiple failed deployments (otsk4efmi, j4sxrdlav, npaquu579)
- **Age: 3m** - Latest deployment **● Ready** ✅

## Root Cause
The `.vercelignore` file contained `tsconfig.json` on line 29, which prevented Vercel from accessing the TypeScript configuration file required for Next.js builds.

```
# Config files
.env*
!.env.production
.eslintrc*
.prettierrc*
jest.config.*
tsconfig.json    ← THIS LINE WAS THE PROBLEM
```

## Why It Failed
- Next.js 15.5.2 requires `tsconfig.json` to compile TypeScript files
- Local builds worked because the file was present locally
- Vercel builds failed because `.vercelignore` prevented the file from being uploaded
- The build failed immediately (0ms) because it couldn't start without TypeScript config

## Fix Applied

### File: `.vercelignore` (line 29)

**Before:**
```
# Config files
.env*
!.env.production
.eslintrc*
.prettierrc*
jest.config.*
tsconfig.json
```

**After:**
```
# Config files
.env*
!.env.production
.eslintrc*
.prettierrc*
jest.config.*
```

**Change:** Removed `tsconfig.json` from the ignore list

## Verification

### Local Build Test
```bash
npm run build
```
**Result:** ✅ Compiled successfully in 2.7s

### Vercel Deployment
```bash
git add .vercelignore
git commit -m "Fix: Remove tsconfig.json from .vercelignore"
git push
```

**Result:** ✅ Deployment successful

## Impact
This fix resolves the Vercel build failures and enables the SignalDeck polling fix to be deployed to production. The complete workflow is now live:

### Working Flow (Now Deployed)
1. User: "Create a presentation about AI safety"
2. NIV: Creates outline ✅
3. User: "Generate the PowerPoint" ✅
4. NIV: "Perfect! I'll generate your SignalDeck PowerPoint presentation" ✅
5. Frontend: Polls status endpoint every 3 seconds ✅
6. After 15-30 seconds: Shows download link ✅
7. User: Downloads .pptx file ✅

## Related Fixes
- `SIGNALDECK_POLLING_FIX.md` - Frontend polling implementation
- `SIGNALDECK_ORGID_FIX.md` - Backend variable naming and JSON parsing

## Lessons Learned
1. `.vercelignore` should only exclude files that are truly not needed for builds
2. Core configuration files like `tsconfig.json`, `next.config.ts`, and `package.json` should NEVER be ignored
3. Always test local builds AND verify Vercel configuration when deployments fail immediately
4. If Vercel shows 0ms build time, it's likely a configuration file is missing
