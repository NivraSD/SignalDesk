# UI Integration Complete - Ready to Test

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Status:** ✅ READY FOR TESTING IN PLATFORM

---

## What Was Completed

### Backend Integration
1. ✅ **Updated campaign builder orchestrator** (`niv-campaign-builder-orchestrator`)
   - Now calls `niv-blueprint-orchestrator-v2` for VECTOR campaigns
   - Replaced old split architecture (phases-1-2 + phases-3-4) with new capability-based architecture
   - File: `supabase/functions/niv-campaign-builder-orchestrator/index.ts:745-773`

2. ✅ **All 7 edge functions deployed**
   - niv-blueprint-influence-mapper
   - niv-blueprint-pattern-selector
   - niv-blueprint-tactical-phases-1-2
   - niv-blueprint-tactical-phases-3-4
   - niv-blueprint-scenario-planner
   - niv-blueprint-resource-calculator
   - niv-blueprint-orchestrator-v2

### Frontend Integration
3. ✅ **BlueprintPresentation component already supports V2**
   - Handles new V2 structure (part1-6)
   - Displays all 6 parts with proper styling
   - Four-pillar rendering with psychological context
   - File: `src/components/campaign-builder/BlueprintPresentation.tsx`

## How It Works Now

### User Flow
```
1. User enters campaign goal → Intent Capture
   ↓
2. Platform runs research pipeline → Research Presentation
   ↓
3. User selects positioning option → Positioning Selection
   ↓
4. User chooses VECTOR campaign → Approach Selection
   ↓
5. Backend calls niv-blueprint-orchestrator-v2 → Blueprint Generation
   ↓
6. Complete 6-part blueprint displayed → Blueprint Presentation
```

### Backend Flow
```
Campaign Builder Wizard
   ↓ calls
/api/campaign-builder-orchestrator
   ↓ calls
niv-campaign-builder-orchestrator (Supabase Edge Function)
   ↓ calls (for VECTOR campaigns)
niv-blueprint-orchestrator-v2
   ↓ executes (3 stages)
STAGE 1 (Parallel):
  - Influence Mapper (~33s)
  - Pattern Selector (~7s)
STAGE 2 (Parallel):
  - Tactical Phases 1-2 (~60s)
  - Tactical Phases 3-4 (~60s)
  - Scenario Planner (~15s)
STAGE 3 (Sequential):
  - Resource Calculator (<1s)
   ↓ returns
Complete 6-Part Blueprint
```

## What You'll See in the UI

### Blueprint Sections (All 6 Parts)

#### Part 1: Strategic Foundation
- Positioning strategy
- Selected pattern (CASCADE, MIRROR, CHORUS, TROJAN, or NETWORK)
- Alternative pattern recommendation
- Campaign timeline
- Target stakeholders list

#### Part 2: Psychological Influence Strategy
- Influence strategies per stakeholder
- 4 influence levers (fear mitigation, aspiration activation, social proof, authority)
- 4-phase touchpoint maps
- Channel strategies based on information diet

#### Part 3: Four-Pillar Tactical Orchestration
All 4 phases (Awareness, Consideration, Conversion, Advocacy), each with:
- **Pillar 1: Owned Actions** (blue border)
  - Organizational voice
  - Content requests with psychological context
  - Timing and distribution channels
- **Pillar 2: Relationship Orchestration** (purple border)
  - Tier 1 influencers with engagement strategies
  - Content to create for them
  - Tier 2 amplifiers
- **Pillar 3: Event Orchestration** (amber border)
  - Tier 1 events with presence strategy
  - Content requirements (pre/during/post event)
- **Pillar 4: Media Engagement** (emerald border)
  - Journalist outreach with real names
  - Story pitches and angles
  - Message layering strategy

#### Part 4: Scenario Planning & Counter-Narratives
- 3-5 threat scenarios across categories:
  - Competitive attacks
  - Technical failures
  - Stakeholder defection
  - Market shifts
  - Social/reputation threats
- Response playbooks with:
  - Immediate actions (0-2h)
  - Short-term counter-narratives (2-24h)
  - Medium-term content creation (1-7d)
  - Escalation triggers

#### Part 5: Resource Requirements & Team Planning
- Content pieces by phase and pillar
- Total hours and budget estimates
- Team size calculation
- Weekly bandwidth requirements
- Adaptation metrics and pivot triggers

#### Part 6: Execution Roadmap
- Week-by-week plan (12 weeks)
- Milestones with success criteria
- Integration instructions for content generation
- Auto-execute ready flag

## Performance Expectations

### Timing
- **Stage 1 (Influence + Pattern):** ~33 seconds (parallel)
- **Stage 2 (Tactical + Scenarios):** ~60 seconds (parallel)
- **Stage 3 (Resources):** <1 second
- **Total:** ~94 seconds (vs 120+ old system)

### Progress Indicators
The UI already shows live progress during blueprint generation:
- Base (Strategic Foundation)
- Orchestration (Tactical Planning)
- Pattern (Pattern Selection)
- Execution (Resource Calculation)
- Merging (Final Assembly)

## How to Test

### 1. Navigate to Campaign Builder
```
http://localhost:3000/campaign-builder
```

### 2. Complete the Flow
1. **Enter a campaign goal**
   - Example: "Launch our new AI-powered DevOps platform to enterprise IT directors and developer team leads. Goal is to position as the only solution combining enterprise reliability with developer velocity."

2. **Wait for research to complete** (~2-3 minutes)
   - You'll see real-time progress indicators

3. **Review and confirm research findings**

4. **Select a positioning option** (3 will be generated)

5. **Choose "VECTOR Campaign"** when prompted for approach

6. **Wait for blueprint generation** (~90 seconds)
   - Progress indicators will show each stage
   - All stages should complete without timeout

7. **Review the complete 6-part blueprint**
   - Expand each section to see full details
   - Check that all parts (1-6) are present
   - Verify Four-Pillar structure in Part 3

### 3. What to Look For

✅ **Success Indicators:**
- All 6 parts present in blueprint
- Part 3 shows all 4 phases (Awareness, Consideration, Conversion, Advocacy)
- Each phase has all 4 pillars (Owned, Relationships, Events, Media)
- Content requests include psychological context
- Real journalist names in Part 3, Pillar 4
- Pattern selection shows rationale (Part 1)
- Threat scenarios with response playbooks (Part 4)
- Resource estimates with hours/budget (Part 5)
- Week-by-week roadmap (Part 6)

❌ **Failure Indicators:**
- Timeout errors after 120 seconds
- Missing parts (only part3 shows)
- Empty sections
- Generic content instead of structured requests
- No psychological levers mentioned

---

## Key Differences from Old System

### Old System (Broken)
- Single monolithic blueprint function
- Frequent timeouts (120+ seconds)
- Only Part 3 (Orchestration) worked
- Parts 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 were missing or broken
- Generic tactical recommendations
- No structured content requests

### New System (V2)
- 7 capability-based functions running in parallel
- No timeouts (~94 seconds total)
- All 6 parts generated and displayed
- Psychological influence mapping
- Structured content requests with context
- Real journalist names from research
- Pattern selection with rationale
- Threat scenarios with response playbooks
- Resource planning with team size estimates

---

## Troubleshooting

### If blueprint generation fails:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check Supabase logs:
   ```bash
   # Check orchestrator V2 logs
   curl -s "https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/zskaxjtyuaqazydouifp/functions/niv-blueprint-orchestrator-v2" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
   ```
3. Check that all edge functions are deployed:
   ```bash
   npx supabase functions list
   ```

### If only Part 3 shows:
- This means the old system is still being called
- Check that `niv-campaign-builder-orchestrator` was redeployed
- Verify it's calling `niv-blueprint-orchestrator-v2` not the old functions

### If timeout occurs:
- Check which stage is timing out (UI shows progress)
- Typical times:
  - Influence Mapper: 30-35s
  - Pattern Selector: 5-10s
  - Tactical Phases: 55-65s each (parallel)
  - Scenario Planner: 10-15s
  - Resource Calculator: <1s

## What's NOT Integrated Yet

### Auto-Execute (Deferred)
- Content generation from blueprint requests
- Integration with niv-content-intelligent-v2
- One-click generation of all content pieces
- **Status:** Will implement after blueprint testing

### UI Enhancements (Future)
- More detailed progress tracking (per-function)
- Blueprint comparison view
- Version history
- Export to various formats (PDF, Word, etc.)
- **Status:** Nice-to-have, not critical

## Files Modified

### Backend
```
✅ supabase/functions/niv-campaign-builder-orchestrator/index.ts (Line 745-773)
   - Changed VECTOR campaign handler to call niv-blueprint-orchestrator-v2
```

### Frontend
```
✅ src/components/campaign-builder/BlueprintPresentation.tsx
   - Already supports V2 structure
   - No changes needed
```

### New Files
```
✅ supabase/functions/niv-blueprint-orchestrator-v2/index.ts
✅ supabase/functions/niv-blueprint-influence-mapper/index.ts
✅ supabase/functions/niv-blueprint-pattern-selector/index.ts
