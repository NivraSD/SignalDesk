## Environment Variables Required
Ensure these are set in Vercel:
```
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_URL=https://zskaxjtyuaqazydouifp.supabase.co
REACT_APP_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=[your-anon-key]
OPENAI_API_KEY=[set in Supabase Edge Function secrets]
```

## Known Issues to Test
1. **CORS**: Verify no CORS errors when calling Supabase function
2. **API Key**: Confirm OpenAI API key is properly configured in Supabase
3. **Artifacts**: Test that artifacts are properly extracted from AI responses
4. **State Management**: Check that state updates correctly across components

## Test Data Examples

### Example 1: Press Release
```
Prompt: "Create a press release announcing our new AI-powered project management tool called TaskMaster Pro"
Expected: Should generate artifact with type "press_release" and formatted content
```

### Example 2: Strategy Document
```
Prompt: "Develop a go-to-market strategy for a B2B SaaS product in the healthcare industry"
Expected: Should create artifact with type "strategy" including sections and bullet points
```

### Example 3: Crisis Plan
```
Prompt: "Create a crisis communication plan for a data breach incident"
Expected: Should generate artifact with type "plan" with step-by-step instructions
```

## Success Criteria
- ✅ User can chat with AI without authentication
- ✅ AI responses include properly formatted artifacts
- ✅ Artifacts display in the artifact panel
- ✅ Workspaces can be created from artifacts
- ✅ UI is responsive and functional
- ✅ No console errors in production

## Debugging Commands
If issues arise, check:
```bash
# View Supabase function logs
npx supabase functions logs niv-simple

# Check Vercel deployment logs
vercel logs

# Test function locally
npx supabase functions serve niv-simple
```

## Final Verification
After 12+ hours of development, the system should:
1. **Work End-to-End**: Chat → AI Response → Artifact → Workspace
2. **Handle Real Content**: Actually process and display AI-generated content
3. **Create Workspaces**: Transform artifacts into actionable workspaces
4. **Be Production Ready**: No authentication required for testing
