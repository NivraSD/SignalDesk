# Claude API Integration - Complete Fix Documentation

## Problem Identified
Only the Content Generator feature was working with Claude, while all other features (Crisis Command Center, Campaign Intelligence, Media List Builder, Stakeholder Intelligence Hub, Opportunity Engine, Intelligence Dashboard) were NOT working.

## Root Cause
1. **Frontend-Backend Mismatch**: The frontend was calling endpoints like `/api/crisis/advisor`, `/api/campaigns/strategy`, etc.
2. **Missing Routes**: These endpoints didn't exist in the regular route files
3. **Enhanced Routes Unused**: The enhanced Claude routes existed at `/api/enhanced/*` but weren't being called by the frontend

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Claude Bridge Routes (`/backend/src/routes/claudeBridgeRoutes.js`)
This new file bridges the gap between what the frontend expects and the Claude AI service. It includes:

- **Crisis Command Center**
  - `/api/crisis/advisor` - Real-time crisis management advice
  - `/api/crisis/draft-response` - Stakeholder-specific communications

- **Campaign Intelligence**
  - `/api/campaigns/strategy` - Advanced AI strategy generation
  - `/api/campaigns/analyze` - Campaign performance analysis

- **Media List Builder**
  - `/api/media/ai-discover-reporters` - Intelligent journalist discovery
  - `/api/media/generate-pitch` - Personalized pitch creation

- **Stakeholder Intelligence**
  - `/api/stakeholder/analyze` - Comprehensive stakeholder mapping

- **Opportunity Engine**
  - `/api/opportunity/discover` - Strategic opportunity identification

- **Intelligence Dashboard**
  - `/api/intelligence/synthesize` - Data synthesis and insights

### 2. Updated Main Server (`/backend/index.js`)
Added the Claude Bridge Routes to the middleware stack, ensuring they're loaded BEFORE other routes to properly intercept frontend API calls.

### 3. Testing Infrastructure
Created `test-claude-integration.js` to verify all Claude features are working correctly.

## How It Works Now

1. **Frontend calls** → `/api/crisis/advisor` (for example)
2. **Claude Bridge Routes** intercept the call
3. **Bridge sends prompt** to Claude API service
4. **Claude responds** with intelligent analysis
5. **Response formatted** to match frontend expectations
6. **Frontend displays** the AI-generated content

## Verification Steps

1. **Start the backend server**:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm start
   ```

2. **Test individual endpoints** (optional):
   ```bash
   # Get a valid token from the browser after logging in
   export TEST_TOKEN="your-token-here"
   node test-claude-integration.js
   ```

3. **Test from frontend**:
   - Open the SignalDesk platform
   - Navigate to any feature (Crisis Command Center, Campaign Intelligence, etc.)
   - Use the AI features - they should all work now\!

## Configuration Required

Ensure these environment variables are set in your Railway deployment:

```env
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your-claude-api-key-here
CLAUDE_MODEL=claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
```

## Deployment

After pushing these changes to Railway:

1. The backend will automatically rebuild
2. All Claude features will be functional
3. Monitor logs to ensure Claude API calls are successful

## Success Indicators

- All platform features display AI-generated content
- No 404 errors in browser console for Claude endpoints
- Response times are reasonable (1-3 seconds for Claude responses)
- Error handling gracefully manages any API issues

## Support

If any issues persist:
1. Check Railway logs for Claude API errors
2. Verify the API key is valid and has sufficient credits
3. Ensure the frontend is calling the correct endpoints
4. Test with the provided test script to isolate issues
