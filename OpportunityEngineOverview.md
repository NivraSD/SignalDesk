What Makes This Different

Traditional PR monitoring tells you what happened.

Uber's Opportunity Engine:

- Predicts what's about to happen
- Prepares response before needed
- Executes faster than competition
- Learns what works for Uber specifically
- Sees opportunities others miss completely

When Lyft's CFO resigns, Uber's response is drafted, approved, and pitched to journalists before Lyft even finishes their
press release.

When NYC proposes gig economy rules, Uber sees the cascade effects across 50 other cities and has campaigns ready for each
market.

When Tesla stumbles on robotaxis, Uber has already positioned their practical approach with key journalists.

This is PR at the speed of opportunity - not just monitoring, but actively hunting for moments where Uber can win.
