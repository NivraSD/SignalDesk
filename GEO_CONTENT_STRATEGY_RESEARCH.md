- **Opportunity:** Real-time updates, news breaking
- **Time to Impact:** Immediate
- **Best For:** News-driven orgs, journalists

**15. Facebook/Instagram**
- **Citation Rate:** <5%
- **Why:** AI platforms don't have access to most content
- **Opportunity:** Minimal
- **Not Recommended** for GEO campaigns

## Adaptive Content Selection Algorithm

```typescript
function selectOptimalContentTypes(
  industry: string,
  objective: 'drive_sales' | 'thought_leadership' | 'technical_adoption',
  constraints: {
    budget: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high',
    timeline: 'urgent' | 'normal' | 'long_term',
    team_size: 'solo' | 'small' | 'large'
  }
): ContentType[] {

  // Start with high-citation, fast-impact types
  let contentTypes = ALL_CONTENT_TYPES
    .filter(ct => ct.objective === objective || ct.objective === 'universal')
    .filter(ct => ct.industryFit.includes(industry))
    .sort((a, b) => {
      // Score = citation_rate * control_level / (time_to_impact * effort)
      const scoreA = (a.citationRate * a.controlLevel) / (a.timeToImpact * a.effort)
      const scoreB = (b.citationRate * b.controlLevel) / (b.timeToImpact * b.effort)
      return scoreB - scoreA
    })

  // Apply constraints
  if (constraints.budget === 'low') {
    contentTypes = contentTypes.filter(ct => ct.effort !== 'very_high')
  }

  if (constraints.timeline === 'urgent') {
    contentTypes = contentTypes.filter(ct => ct.timeToImpact <= 4) // weeks
  }

  if (constraints.team_size === 'solo') {
    contentTypes = contentTypes.filter(ct =>
      ct.executionType === 'automated' || ct.executionType === 'user_assisted'
    )
  }

  // Return top 5-7
  return contentTypes.slice(0, 7)
}
```

## Bottom Line: Reddit Reality Check

**Reddit is overrated for most GEO campaigns:**
- Only 10-20% citation rate (vs 70%+ for docs/comparison sites)
- Perplexity cites Reddit more, but it's <5% of AI market
- AMAs require significant effort and community building
- Most B2B queries don't cite Reddit at all

**When Reddit IS valuable:**
- Consumer products (r/BuyItForLife, r/ProductivityApps)
- Gaming (r/gaming, r/pcgaming)
- Niche technical (r/golang, r/kubernetes)
- Investment/personal finance (r/investing, r/wallstreetbets)

**Better alternatives:**
- Documentation (75% citation, full control)
- Comparison sites (65% citation, easy to optimize)
- LinkedIn (45% citation, 1-2 week impact)
- Case studies (60% citation, full control)
